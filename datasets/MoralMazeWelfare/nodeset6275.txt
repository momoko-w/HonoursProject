<span class="highlighted" id="node1">Now you used the word ‘incentive’</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node7">and there are two different ways of
improving the incentives to work</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node16">One is to change the balance of or the generosity
of out of work beneifts, maybe spend more on in work benefits like tax credits
and so on</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node31">Maybe we could turn our tax credits, which aren’t really tax credits
in the UK, into something you only get paid if you’re working</span>; <span class="highlighted" id="node46">that would be a
good way of incentivising work</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node61">But we’ve thought too much, funnily, about the
financial incentives to work, and not enough about the conditionality in the
system</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node76">What do we ask people to do in return for their
benefits?</span>

<span class="highlighted" id="node91">The idea of ‘Work Fair’, or of conditionality, is incredibly popular</span>.
About 80% of people support the idea that <span class="highlighted" id="node123">if you’ve been on out of work
benefits for more than a year, you should be asked to do community work in
return for your benefits</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node142">And they are right about that</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node157">because we know that
these programs from other countries, they work</span>; <span class="highlighted" id="node172">they really reduce
unemployment</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node187">In one of the US states that went the furthest in this in
diverting people from being on welfare, they managed at one point to reduce the
number of people on benefits by 90%</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node202">This is a huge opportunity that we’ve
barely begun to explore in the UK system</span>.
