I think it's very different when the market doesn't necessarily support ... so <span class="highlighted" id="node90">you used broadband as an example</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node97">The market doesn't necessarily support the rollout of broadband to these deeply rural areas</span> because, <span class="highlighted" id="node104">in the same way that housing is an issue, it's not always economically viable to do that</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node115">there needs to be support mechanisms in place to actually deal with some of these issues</span>.
