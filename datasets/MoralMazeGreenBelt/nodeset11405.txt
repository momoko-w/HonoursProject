Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node1">Our last witness, Howard Davies</span>. I<span class="highlighted" id="node6">t got to an interesting binary issue - I can't remember who raised it with him - about whether the social was more important than the natural</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node11">Is that not what it boils down to, Poppy, do you think</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node16">It's human utility, it's ... human beings are much more important than any old tree is, as somebody mentioned</span>.<br>Poppy Cleary:	<span class="highlighted" id="node21">I would agree with that statement</span>. I think <span class="highlighted" id="node44">human beings are more important than the tree</span>. Obviously, <span class="highlighted" id="node55">we need some sort of greenery and environment in order to have a remotely sustainable being</span>, but I don't think that <span class="highlighted" id="node60">nature holds any sort of moral superiority to humans</span>. I think <span class="highlighted" id="node65">humans are dominant over nature</span>, and I think it <span class="highlighted" id="node70">should continue that wa</span>y. I don't think <span class="highlighted" id="node75">there should be areas that exempt from that</span>.<br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	<span class="highlighted" id="node95">I think you'll [crosstalk 00:45:01] that humans are in fact part of nature</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node106">Maddie</span>?<br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	<span class="highlighted" id="node114">I don't think we can separate ourselves out</span>.

Or look out and see some greenery, and have that connection with the natural world that <span class="highlighted" id="node178">we have so long been taught to ignore as people. Which is just wrong.</span><br>Poppy Cleary:	But <span class="highlighted" id="node230">that's a connection that you have [crosstalk 00:45:53] to the natural world, that's not a connection that I have to the natural world</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node210">Poppy</span>.<br>Poppy Cleary:	<span class="highlighted" id="node215">I don't think that is part of my identity</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node220">I can understand that I'm part of an ecosystem and that I utilise as a human parts of the environment</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node225">I don't think that people's value of nature should equate to a law or equate to regulations that stop me developing</span>.<br><br>
