Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node1">Our next witness is Tom Fyans, who's director of campaigns and policy at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the CPRE</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node13">Some green belt land is beautiful, but a lot isn't</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node20">It's far bigger than it was originally intended</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node31">the country's desperate for housing</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node42">A human is less important than hedgerows</span>?<br>Tom Fyans:	<span class="highlighted" id="node49">Of course not</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node62">it's also the most popular planning tool we've had since the war</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node84">It is to prevent urban sprawl, to stop growth, to promote urban regeneration</span> ... but <span class="highlighted" id="node95">most importantly in a lot of ways now, it's the countryside next door for 30 million people</span>. So<span class="highlighted" id="node106"> when we talk about their wellbeing, the origins of the green belt were green lawns around the cities, for the workers to escape from the industrial conditions they were in for their health and wellbeing</span> ... <span class="highlighted" id="node117">that's what it was for</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node128">it still happens now</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node135">There's a huge store of national capital in the green belt</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node146"> it's worth preserving</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node157">we should be very proud of it</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node168">the world is envious of the green belt and has tried to copy it</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node179">George</span><br>George Buskell:	Surely <span class="highlighted" id="node186">the issue is that the green belt's almost completely outdated by now</span>. I mean, last I checked, <span class="highlighted" id="node197">it's not 1955 any more</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node208">any policy that lasts that long surely needs to be at least updated and changed to suit modern needs</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node215">We live in a very different time now</span>.<br>Tom Fyans:	I think <span class="highlighted" id="node226">it's more relevant than ever</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node237">If you look at the threats of climate change, we need green spaces around our cities more than ever</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node248">We need to flood resilient carbon capture</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node259">We need farmland that's productive to produce food in the cities</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node270">With a growing population, green spaces become more valuable and more environmentally important</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node286">no</span>, I think <span class="highlighted" id="node299">it's the opposite</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node318">It's been a successful policy</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node330">I came on the train this morning from London</span> ... <span class="highlighted" id="node337">if we didn't have the green belt, Faversham would be part of London</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node344">The same growth as L.A. has experienced in the last fifty years</span> ... <span class="highlighted" id="node355">we'd be sitting in London right now</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node366">It might have been an easier journey, but it certainly wouldn't have been a more beautiful one</span>.<br>George Buskell:	Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node390">you mentioned that we have a growing population</span>, but surely <span class="highlighted" id="node405">the point is that we do have a growing population</span>. And so <span class="highlighted" id="node416">we need to build more homes</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node427"><span class="highlighted" id="node428">we need to do it quickly</span></span>. I mean, <span class="highlighted" id="node438">we're living in a time where millions of people can't actually afford homes in their local area</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node451">Isn't that an issue</span>?<br>Tom Fyans:	<span class="highlighted" id="node462">Yes</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node471">we really do need more homes</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node481">CPRE really supports the right homes in the right places</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node492"><span class="highlighted" id="node493">The issue isn't land area</span></span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node504">it's housing building rates</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node511">With this planning permissions for half a million homes that are being sat on, I came through Ebbsfleet in Kent on the train earlier on the train as well</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node522">They have built 500 houses in the last nine years on a development there</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node533"> Nine years it's taken to build 500 houses</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node544">That's their planning permission for nine years, for 15 thousand houses</span>.
