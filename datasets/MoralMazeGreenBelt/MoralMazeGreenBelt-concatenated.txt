Michael Buerk:	Right. To tonight's subject. <span class="highlighted" id="node1">For my generation, home ownership has been a one-way ticket to prosperity</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">Some have made more from their houses than from a lifetime of work</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node17">For the generation that form our audience here at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, it will likely be an increasingly impossible dream</span>.Michael Buerk:Michael Buerk:	Maddie.<br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	I would kind of like to jump on your feeling of responsibility to my generation, really.<span class="highlighted" id="node14"> I think that's all well and good</span>, but <span class="highlighted hlcurrent" id="node15">don't we surely have a responsibility to the generations that come after me?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node16">Don't we have a responsibility to preserve nature for them?</span><br>Shiv Malik:	Yes.<br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	<span class="highlighted" id="node44">So with your kind of new emphasis on development, are you kind of okay with letting loose on the greenfield cites,</span> and maybe, <span class="highlighted" id="node45">possibly leaving my children, my grandchildren with a world of concrete?</span><br>Shiv Malik:	<span class="highlighted" id="node72">Okay, so ... we have this, as human beings we have wonderful sets of systematic biases in how we see the world.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node73">So most of us travel from one built-up area to another.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node95">And so we think, in England, that most of it's built up.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node106">Now if I asked most people what percentage of England </span>- <span class="highlighted" id="node107">just England, not Scotland or Wales - just England</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node108">that tends to be the place that people focus on as most built-up.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node123">What percentage is actually built-up?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node148">The answer might be 20% or 50%</span>, but<span class="highlighted" id="node156"> it actually turns out to be 11%</span>. But<span class="highlighted" id="node150"> it's actually less than that</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node151">that includes all the parks, and all the gardens, and all the rivers and canals, and it turns out that actually three percent is concreted over.</span><br>	Now,<span class="highlighted" id="node195"> can we extend that by a percent?</span> Absolutely. <span class="highlighted" id="node197">What are we giving up for that? </span>Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node218">we have to ask ourselves that question</span>, sure. <span class="highlighted" id="node243">But if that also means that the lives of not just our generation of people under thirty-five, but every other corresponding generation after this is going to be much lower than even their parents ... then that's a terrible incitement of both us as a society, </span>but <span class="highlighted" id="node228">also what are we doing for nature in that regard?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node252">If we're going to be a sort of declining society, we aren't going to be able to fix the sort of problems, the environmental problems that we need to do.</span><br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	See, that kind of brings me on to my next point. I mean, <span class="highlighted" id="node262">you yourself say that now we know more than ever about kind of the environmental situations that we ourselves are creating. </span><span class="highlighted" id="node263">Surely there's an argument for saying that my generation should be the first generation to say "you know what?

Great!

Our currently - our cities in this country certainly are incredibly environmentally destructive. Just take traffic, for example. It creates a whole load of Co2 because cars can't get from one place to another, cos they're congested. That's just one little small thing. Imagine a city in which there wasn't not just traffic, but also you could build homes and houses and entire buildings and streets built with solar panels ... suddenly you start to re-imagine your environment, and working harmoniously with it, rather than living in basically Victorian cities, which weren't designed to live and breathe environmentally, if you want.<br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	Surely that's not good for development within the cities, rather than expanding outwards, to restrict kind of the damage that urban areas do.<br>Shiv Malik:	Well, the problem with that is that people already own that land.

including the quarter of a million people who are homeless in this country - are very, very distant third in that pecking order. </span>So yes, <span class="highlighted" id="node65">I agree that the development sector needs urgent reform to provide the homes that we actually need, not just profits.</span><br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	<span class="highlighted" id="node108">So, I would like to bring you back onto this kind of point about our obligation to nature now that we know more.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node109">How do we know that we don't continue doing the damage that we have so far?</span><br>Toby Lloyd:<span class="highlighted" id="node122">	Firstly, the planning system, I think, does have strong tools for protection nature.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node123">Things like national parks, areas of outstanding national beauty ... these are all outstanding policies for protecting the really really valuable bits of nature ...</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node124">I just don't think that the green belt per say is a particularly effective way of protecting nature.</span><span class="highlighted" id="node125"> And in many ways, it's quite damaging.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node126">Millions of people commute every day across the greenbelt, twice. That is adding hugely to the carbon impact on ... of the economy,</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node127">they cannot live close to where the jobs are, because green belt policies insist that we build homes off and on greenfield sites beyond the green belt,</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node128">then demand that people commute thirty miles into town to work.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node129">That cannot be an environmentally sustainable or sensible position.</span><br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node1">Jane</span>.<br>Jane Fidge:	Okay, <span class="highlighted" id="node6">for you ... is it a case of the collective good versus the individual good that's the problem here</span>?<br>Toby Lloyd:	<span class="highlighted" id="node13">Yes</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node26">it is certainly a tension right at the heart of all planning decisions, and at the heart of property itself</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node37">By owning any property, you are inherently engaged in a tension between the rights of the individual and the surrounding community</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node48">The very debate we are having here is about the fact that some people may own bits of land, and may want to do things like develop it or farm it, and other people may have justifiable interest in that land ... heter as provision of recreation space or just a good view, or the value of nature</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node69">yes</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node64">it is about that tension</span>.<br>Jane Fidge:	But <span class="highlighted" id="node88">don't you think that maybe sort of small villages, communities, towns, families ... do they not count as their own collective</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node99">Do they not have their own collective good, to not think of their opinion</span> ... <span class="highlighted" id="node110">because often, small villages will want to maintain their green belt, their area, their sort of beauty of their area</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node121"> Do you not think that we should value their opinion</span>?<br>Toby Lloyd:	<span class="highlighted" id="node128">Absolutely</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node137">one of the problems with our development system is that it does not work anywhere closely enough or effectively enough with local communities</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node148">We do a lot of work with people who resist development</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node159">they will tell you overwhelmingly that it's not the principle of houses being built that the oppose</span> ... actually, <span class="highlighted" id="node174">lots of villages are worried that their villages are dying</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node183">Their schools are closing</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node194">their shops can't stay open</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node201">they don't have the population</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node223">What they don't want is ugly, unsustainable, overpriced, badly supported housing being plunked onto their villages knowing that no one who lives there will be able to afford those homes</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node234">What they do want is genuinely sustainable, good-quality affordable housing, so that local people can afford to continue on living there</span>.<br>Jane Fidge:	But <span class="highlighted" id="node245">there must be people out there that just want to maintain the green belt for natural value, not just because they want, you know, sustainable housing</span>. Because <span class="highlighted" id="node256">they actually want to maintain the environment</span>.<br>Toby Lloyd:	<span class="highlighted" id="node267">There are some</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node276">there are also people who will resist any development at all</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node283">Mostly, those are people who are extremely well-housed themselves</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node294">The people who never get a say in these debates are people who are not well-housed, who have no hope of being able to rent or buy a decent place themselves</span>.<br>Jane Fidge:	So, <span class="highlighted" id="node305">does that sort of mean that poorer people who then can't access this kind of housing, do they not really care about nature</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node325">Would they rather just, you know ...

I think it's very different when the market doesn't necessarily support ... so <span class="highlighted" id="node90">you used broadband as an example</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node97">The market doesn't necessarily support the rollout of broadband to these deeply rural areas</span> because, <span class="highlighted" id="node104">in the same way that housing is an issue, it's not always economically viable to do that</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node115">there needs to be support mechanisms in place to actually deal with some of these issues</span>.

I mean all our witnesses had powerful arguments and well-organised arguments</span> ... <span class="highlighted" id="node11">Tom Fyans' argument was centred on that there's a moral value to landscape, above and beyond human utility</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node16">Is that something you would take issue with</span>?<br>George Buskell:	<span class="highlighted" id="node30">Yeah</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node47">I mean we would have to place moral importance on elements of landscape</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node58">People obviously get a lot of enjoyment out of countryside</span>. T<span class="highlighted" id="node63">he issue is when there are genuine human needs, like development and infrastructure, they need to be taken into account first</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node76">The argument I suppose that would resonate with a lot of people that Tom Fyans made</span> was that<span class="highlighted" id="node81"> actually green belt was made as attractive to developers</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node86">it's cheap to build on</span>, not because <span class="highlighted" id="node91">it's the only place where you can build homes</span>.<br>George Buskell:<span class="highlighted" id="node118">	If it is truly the case that developers only want to build on the green belt because it's cheap and because they want to increase their profit margins</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node129">that's obviously a problem</span> and<span class="highlighted" id="node134"> we should look to other places</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node156">if it turns out to be the easiest and simplest solution to the problem</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node161">the problem at hand is big</span>, and<span class="highlighted" id="node166"> it's getting worse</span>. And so, <span class="highlighted" id="node171">perhaps we may have to look at the cheapest and easiest solution</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	And <span class="highlighted" id="node192">Jane, his argument that, you know, if it wasn't for the green belt that Faversham would be on the outer ends of L.A., is that ... actually, that sounds rather attractive, come to think of it</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node199">no, no, no. No.</span><br><span class="highlighted" id="node211">Jane Fidge</span>:	No, I think <span class="highlighted" id="node222">that's a very powerful point</span>. Because I think that, really,<span class="highlighted" id="node233"> when you go on the train from Faversham and you go up to London ... when you're sitting in that train, you don't really appreciate what you're going past</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node244">this is miles and miles and miles of greenfield</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node251">we would surely notice that, if that was all buildings</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node258">We would look out the window, and this sounds such a stupid point, but it would make train journeys so boring, if all you ever see out the window is the same thing over and over</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node269">And Poppy, somebody said "what's wrong with urban sprawl?"</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node274">What is wrong with urban sprawl</span>?<br>Poppy Cleary:	<span class="highlighted" id="node283">I don't think there is anything wrong with urban sprawl</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node299">Like one of the witnesses outlined, if we didn't have the green belt than Faversham would be part of London</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node304">that's great</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node309">I'd love that</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node314">I think that would be beneficial to people</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node325">I think that city growth and the growth of areas where people want to live is important</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node330">it's a benefit to humanity</span>.Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node1">Can we make this a doubles match as well as a singles match</span>?<br>	<span class="highlighted" id="node6">George, it's quite interesting with our next witness, Toby Lloyd, where ... or maybe I wasn't following it closely enough, but it's quite interesting with this argument about how much <span class="highlighted" id="node20">it is to do with the individuals' rights and responsibilities versus the communities'</span>, and which way round that argument was</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node35">Where do you think the locus of that argument lies</span>?<br>George Buskell:	<span class="highlighted" id="node44">I think that the people that are in need of the homes are the community</span>, and that <span class="highlighted" id="node62">ultimately they are being stopped by the individuals that perpetuate this. Sort of like an attitude towards homes where they're like an investment, rather than a place to live</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	So <span class="highlighted" id="node69">when the Faversham Heritage Society, if there is such a thing, objects to development plans, they're just a collection of atomised individuals, are they? With less moral force</span>.<br>George Buskell:	<span class="highlighted" id="node87">I guess they've become sort of like a sort of a difference between the collective good and what the community wants</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node98">I think there definitely is a difference</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node109">people aren't infallible</span>.Michael Buerk:	But Jane, <span class="highlighted" id="node10">do you not think that Toby had a point</span> when he said that "<span class="highlighted" id="node1">if you're looking at it from an environmental perspective, here are people who are having to commute across the green belt" with its own inherent environmental problems</span>?<br>Jane Fidge:	<span class="highlighted" id="node21">Obviously there's an issue with people having to commute to work</span>. But<span class="highlighted" id="node32"> I think that really, is the slight annoyance of having to get on a train to go to where you work or to go wherever, compared to sort of preserving nature</span>? And <span class="highlighted" id="node43">to me that sounds like a much bigger sort of pro</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node54">To me, that's just ... that doesn't even ask a question</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node65">THat's just nature and someone having to be on a train for an extra 20 minutes. What do we value more</span>?<br>Poppy Cleary:	<span class="highlighted" id="node76">You can still preserve nature [crosstalk 00:42:17] whilst accepting that cities can expand a bit</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node87">Poppy</span>.<br>Poppy Cleary:	<span class="highlighted" id="node94">You can still preserve vast areas of nature in nature whilst accepting that you don't want a two hour commute into the city where your job is</span>.<br>Jane Fidge:	Where would you ...<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node105">Go on, Jane</span>.<br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	<span class="highlighted" id="node112">Well ... oh, sorry</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node119">Oh sorry, go on Jane</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node126">Jane first, then Maddie</span>.<br>Jane Fidge:	<span class="highlighted" id="node133">Where would you stop with this development</span>, 'cos <span class="highlighted" id="node140">there's gonna be people everywhere</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node151">how - where are you going to stop this development to sort of make it easier for everyone to get to work</span>?<br>Poppy Cleary:	While still having [crosstalk 00:42:43] development in society.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node162">Poppy</span>.<br>Poppy Cleary:	<span class="highlighted" id="node169">Like was point upon earlier by some of the witnesses. You can create new cities</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node184">You could completely re-imagine the environment and the landscape in which we live in</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node195">there hasn't been a new major city in years and years and years</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node206">We can completely restructure the way that we live in</span>.<br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	<span class="highlighted" id="node217">I think you'll find [crosstalk 00:43:02] that if you end up doing that ...<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node222">Maddie</span>?<br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	... Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node1">Our last witness, Howard Davies</span>. I<span class="highlighted" id="node6">t got to an interesting binary issue - I can't remember who raised it with him - about whether the social was more important than the natural</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node11">Is that not what it boils down to, Poppy, do you think</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node16">It's human utility, it's ... human beings are much more important than any old tree is, as somebody mentioned</span>.<br>Poppy Cleary:	<span class="highlighted" id="node21">I would agree with that statement</span>. I think <span class="highlighted" id="node44">human beings are more important than the tree</span>. Obviously, <span class="highlighted" id="node55">we need some sort of greenery and environment in order to have a remotely sustainable being</span>, but I don't think that <span class="highlighted" id="node60">nature holds any sort of moral superiority to humans</span>. I think <span class="highlighted" id="node65">humans are dominant over nature</span>, and I think it <span class="highlighted" id="node70">should continue that wa</span>y. I don't think <span class="highlighted" id="node75">there should be areas that exempt from that</span>.<br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	<span class="highlighted" id="node95">I think you'll [crosstalk 00:45:01] that humans are in fact part of nature</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node106">Maddie</span>?<br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	<span class="highlighted" id="node114">I don't think we can separate ourselves out</span>. I mean, a<span class="highlighted" id="node130">s much as we like to think we can dominate it and that we're somehow masters of the natural realm</span>, I'm afraid <span class="highlighted" id="node137">it was here long before us</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node142">it'll be here long after we're gone</span> and ...<span class="highlighted" id="node155"> it was picked on a little bit in the debate, but I don't think we really put as much emphasis as we should on our connection with nature</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node160">Looking into - this is going to sound rather stupid, but looking into development for new hospital blocks, for example ... there has been a lot of emphasis on making sure people that are lying in their beds can look out their window and see a garden</span>. Or look out and see some greenery, and have that connection with the natural world that <span class="highlighted" id="node178">we have so long been taught to ignore as people. Which is just wrong.</span><br>Poppy Cleary:	But <span class="highlighted" id="node230">that's a connection that you have [crosstalk 00:45:53] to the natural world, that's not a connection that I have to the natural world</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node210">Poppy</span>.<br>Poppy Cleary:	<span class="highlighted" id="node215">I don't think that is part of my identity</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node220">I can understand that I'm part of an ecosystem and that I utilise as a human parts of the environment</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node225">I don't think that people's value of nature should equate to a law or equate to regulations that stop me developing</span>.<br><br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node1">George ... just going back to what Howard Davies was saying as our last witness</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node6"> He was saying that even going along with the human utility argument, which you've espoused, it is rather important to us for utilitarian reasons</span>.<br>George Buskell:	Yeah.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node22">If we develop on floodplains, we get a lot of flooding</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node27"> our health is essentially - probably our physical and our mental health - are banned up in an environment which we enjoy and doesn't threaten us</span>.<br>George Buskell:	<span class="highlighted" id="node40">I definitely argue that nature has utility</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node51">as someone previously pointed out, the green belt isn't necessarily nature</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node56">a lot of the green belt, although you can say "Oh, it's very nice. We can go out to this park, we can all go out and have some fun"</span>. Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node61">not everyone can</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node66">a lot of it is actually used for ridiculous things, like private golf courses</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node71"> Well who benefits from that</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node76">The people who can afford to play golf</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node81">It's not all valuable, in that sense</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node125">I must add golf club members to the list of well-heeled, affluent, and old people who have</span> ...<br>	<span class="highlighted" id="node132">Jane, come on</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node137"> Last word, with you</span>.<br>Jane Fidge:	<span class="highlighted" id="node146">I think it was a very important point to make, that actually we need nature</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node151">We can't just brush it off as a few trees that we're getting rid of</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node156">Fundamentally, humans need nature to survive</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node161"> We can't just sort of say "We need houses, so let's build it ... nature's gone, we won't be able to breathe, but it's fine".</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node166">The fact that you're trying to boil it down to such a binary social and sort of the natural world ... you can't, </span>because <span class="highlighted" id="node171">it's such a blurred line between the two</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node177">and</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node176">it's so interconnected</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node195"> You cannot really separate them</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node206">I think if you try to do that, then it becomes quite a dangerous argument</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node211"> I think you really have to think about the implications that both have on each other</span>.<br><br>Michael Buerk:	Okay. So <span class="highlighted" id="node1">let's now turn to our established panel</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">Affluent, well-heeled, old golf club member, Claire Fox</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node13">How's your chipping these days</span>?<br>Claire Fox:	But look. <span class="highlighted" id="node20">An interesting example of the dilemma we've got is that one of the panel made</span> the point of, you know, <span class="highlighted" id="node27">when you're in your hospital bed, nature is valuable for humans</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node34">you look out and see</span>, you know ...<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node45">That was Maddie</span>, I think.<br>Claire Fox:	<span class="highlighted" id="node52">Yes, Maddie</span>. That ... <span class="highlighted" id="node61">great point</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node68">that's a wonderful way to think of nature</span>. And then I think ... but what I would say is, <span class="highlighted" id="node75">I want to be able to build the hospital</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node80">I want to be able to create antibiotics</span>, and to be honest with you, <span class="highlighted" id="node85">I want a cure that's beyond looking out the window at the field</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node90">The field is a nice thing that we as humans might add</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node95">it's very low down the pecking order of, in my sense, a sense of priorities</span>.<br>	So I suppose that <span class="highlighted" id="node100">what I wanted to get over today is not that I despise the beauty of nature</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node105">although we've established that just 'cos the green belt's called "green" it's not necessarily beautiful greenery</span>, but it's also the case that I think <span class="highlighted" id="node110">we are above and beyond nature</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node115">Nature is now at our service</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node120">that's it's great beauty</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node173">Matthew</span>?<br>Matthew Taylor:	And <span class="highlighted" id="node180">one of the things about human being should be our capacity for imagination</span>. And what I found very disappointing in <span class="highlighted" id="node192">the arguments that we heard from Shiv Malik and Tobey Lloyd was a kind of lack of imagination</span>. You know, they're ... <span class="highlighted" id="node203">we could massively increase the density of our cities</span>. You know, <span class="highlighted" id="node214">as Jane said, there are 25 million empty bedrooms in our cities</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node234">We can have land taxes</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node245">There are all sorts of ways we could accommodate more people in better cities without having to damage nature</span>. And you know ... and yet ... <span class="highlighted" id="node274">why is nature the victim of the human failure of our planning policy</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node279">Why don't we have human solutions to human problems</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node284"> rather than saying "Well because we can't resolve this</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node293">because we can't resolve inequality</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node302">we can't make developers more imaginative</span> ... well, <span class="highlighted" id="node311">it's the green belt that has to suffer for our failure</span>".<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node353">Anne McElvoy has the answer to that question</span>.<br>Anne McElvoy:	Well, I thought <span class="highlighted" id="node360">it was an interesting example of where there was a conflation, really, between what the green belt</span> was - <span class="highlighted" id="node367">is it symbolic</span>, or <span class="highlighted" id="node372">is it really a thing in itself</span>? And I thought <span class="highlighted" id="node381">what we had tonight was an argument which we started out talking about whether the green belt was full of golf courses</span> or <span class="highlighted" id="node386">this marvellous bit of nature that Goethe would have celebrated, had he been around now</span>.
