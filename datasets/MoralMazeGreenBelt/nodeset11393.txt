Michael Buerk:	Maddie.<br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	I would kind of like to jump on your feeling of responsibility to my generation, really.<span class="highlighted" id="node14"> I think that's all well and good</span>, but <span class="highlighted hlcurrent" id="node15">don't we surely have a responsibility to the generations that come after me?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node16">Don't we have a responsibility to preserve nature for them?</span><br>Shiv Malik:	Yes.<br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	<span class="highlighted" id="node44">So with your kind of new emphasis on development, are you kind of okay with letting loose on the greenfield cites,</span> and maybe, <span class="highlighted" id="node45">possibly leaving my children, my grandchildren with a world of concrete?</span><br>Shiv Malik:	<span class="highlighted" id="node72">Okay, so ... we have this, as human beings we have wonderful sets of systematic biases in how we see the world.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node73">So most of us travel from one built-up area to another.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node95">And so we think, in England, that most of it's built up.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node106">Now if I asked most people what percentage of England </span>- <span class="highlighted" id="node107">just England, not Scotland or Wales - just England</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node108">that tends to be the place that people focus on as most built-up.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node123">What percentage is actually built-up?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node148">The answer might be 20% or 50%</span>, but<span class="highlighted" id="node156"> it actually turns out to be 11%</span>. But<span class="highlighted" id="node150"> it's actually less than that</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node151">that includes all the parks, and all the gardens, and all the rivers and canals, and it turns out that actually three percent is concreted over.</span><br>	Now,<span class="highlighted" id="node195"> can we extend that by a percent?</span> Absolutely. <span class="highlighted" id="node197">What are we giving up for that? </span>Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node218">we have to ask ourselves that question</span>, sure. <span class="highlighted" id="node243">But if that also means that the lives of not just our generation of people under thirty-five, but every other corresponding generation after this is going to be much lower than even their parents ... then that's a terrible incitement of both us as a society, </span>but <span class="highlighted" id="node228">also what are we doing for nature in that regard?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node252">If we're going to be a sort of declining society, we aren't going to be able to fix the sort of problems, the environmental problems that we need to do.</span><br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	See, that kind of brings me on to my next point. I mean, <span class="highlighted" id="node262">you yourself say that now we know more than ever about kind of the environmental situations that we ourselves are creating. </span><span class="highlighted" id="node263">Surely there's an argument for saying that my generation should be the first generation to say "you know what? I'm going to settle for less. I'm going to appreciate the damage that development has done to our kind of environment"</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node264">Surely we should be the ones to take that moral stand.</span><br>Shiv Malik:	<span class="highlighted" id="node304">That argument leads you in two directions. </span><span class="highlighted" id="node305">One is, look, we should not just settle for less, but we basically go back to being purely environmental being.</span> In which case, <span class="highlighted" id="node306">go! Great! Be a hunter-gatherer, right?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node337">Cos that's the least environmentally-destructive position that you can take.</span> I don't want that. <span class="highlighted" id="node339">So we've got to find a middle ground.</span><br>	The other solution is to say "well look, hang on. Our currently - our cities in this country certainly are incredibly environmentally destructive. Just take traffic, for example. It creates a whole load of Co2 because cars can't get from one place to another, cos they're congested. That's just one little small thing. Imagine a city in which there wasn't not just traffic, but also you could build homes and houses and entire buildings and streets built with solar panels ... suddenly you start to re-imagine your environment, and working harmoniously with it, rather than living in basically Victorian cities, which weren't designed to live and breathe environmentally, if you want.<br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	Surely that's not good for development within the cities, rather than expanding outwards, to restrict kind of the damage that urban areas do.<br>Shiv Malik:	Well, the problem with that is that people already own that land. So I'm less willing to evict those people at very high cost, then we're gonna be stuck.<br>Michael Buerk:	Shiv Malik, thank you very much indeed.<br>Shiv Malik:	Thank you.<br><br>
