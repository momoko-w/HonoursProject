Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node1">Jane</span>.<br>Jane Fidge:	Okay, <span class="highlighted" id="node6">for you ... is it a case of the collective good versus the individual good that's the problem here</span>?<br>Toby Lloyd:	<span class="highlighted" id="node13">Yes</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node26">it is certainly a tension right at the heart of all planning decisions, and at the heart of property itself</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node37">By owning any property, you are inherently engaged in a tension between the rights of the individual and the surrounding community</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node48">The very debate we are having here is about the fact that some people may own bits of land, and may want to do things like develop it or farm it, and other people may have justifiable interest in that land ... heter as provision of recreation space or just a good view, or the value of nature</span>. So <span class="highlighted" id="node69">yes</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node64">it is about that tension</span>.<br>Jane Fidge:	But <span class="highlighted" id="node88">don't you think that maybe sort of small villages, communities, towns, families ... do they not count as their own collective</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node99">Do they not have their own collective good, to not think of their opinion</span> ... <span class="highlighted" id="node110">because often, small villages will want to maintain their green belt, their area, their sort of beauty of their area</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node121"> Do you not think that we should value their opinion</span>?<br>Toby Lloyd:	<span class="highlighted" id="node128">Absolutely</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node137">one of the problems with our development system is that it does not work anywhere closely enough or effectively enough with local communities</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node148">We do a lot of work with people who resist development</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node159">they will tell you overwhelmingly that it's not the principle of houses being built that the oppose</span> ... actually, <span class="highlighted" id="node174">lots of villages are worried that their villages are dying</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node183">Their schools are closing</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node194">their shops can't stay open</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node201">they don't have the population</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node223">What they don't want is ugly, unsustainable, overpriced, badly supported housing being plunked onto their villages knowing that no one who lives there will be able to afford those homes</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node234">What they do want is genuinely sustainable, good-quality affordable housing, so that local people can afford to continue on living there</span>.<br>Jane Fidge:	But <span class="highlighted" id="node245">there must be people out there that just want to maintain the green belt for natural value, not just because they want, you know, sustainable housing</span>. Because <span class="highlighted" id="node256">they actually want to maintain the environment</span>.<br>Toby Lloyd:	<span class="highlighted" id="node267">There are some</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node276">there are also people who will resist any development at all</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node283">Mostly, those are people who are extremely well-housed themselves</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node294">The people who never get a say in these debates are people who are not well-housed, who have no hope of being able to rent or buy a decent place themselves</span>.<br>Jane Fidge:	So, <span class="highlighted" id="node305">does that sort of mean that poorer people who then can't access this kind of housing, do they not really care about nature</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node325">Would they rather just, you know ... "let's just build on the green belt</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node340">I need houses</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node358">get rid of nature</span>".<br>Toby Lloyd:	<span class="highlighted" id="node377">No</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node392">this is just illustrative of how there are always tensions between different interests in society</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node404">I don't see why we should always prejudice the interests of well-heeled, affluent, usually older homeowners over the interests of everyone else</span>.<br><br>
