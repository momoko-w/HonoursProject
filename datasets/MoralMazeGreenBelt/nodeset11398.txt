Michael Buerk:	Our next witness is Toby Lloyd, who's head of housing development at Shelter, and co-author of a new book, Rethinking the Economics of Land and Housing, which places it squarely in today's issue. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">Toby Lloyd, is your basic position that "all property is theft", but home ownership is particularly pernicious and damaging to society?</span><br>Toby Lloyd:	No, absolutely not. <span class="highlighted" id="node32">That quote we use from Proudhon we use in the book, really, to expose the contradictions and tensions at the heart of the housing system, which are in fact at the heart of the liberal concept of private property and land. </span><span class="highlighted" id="node39">Proudhon also said that "property is liberty"</span>, and <span class="highlighted hlcurrent" id="node40">our conjecture is that he was right on both counts</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node41">Property is both things.</span><br>Michael Buerk:	Okay, Maddie.<br>Maddie Groeger-Wilson:	Right. <span class="highlighted" id="node79">I want to pull it a little bit back to nature, rather than buildings.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node80">So, nature's value ... is it intrinsic, or is it instrumental?</span><br>Toby Lloyd:	<span class="highlighted" id="node93">Well firstly, if we're talking about green belt, as we've already heard that doesn't actually already have anything to do with the intrinsic value of nature.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node94">It is a planning policy for the containment of urban areas.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node95">And in fact, I suspect the debate would have been very different if all this time, instead of being called "green belt" it had been called "urban containment zones", or something kind of technical as most planning policies are ... we'd probably be having a very different conversation.</span>
