Michael Buerk:	Poppy, Poppy Cleary?<br>Poppy Cleary:	Yes, my first question to you is: <span class="highlighted" id="node1">the green belt was created in 1955</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node6">as George already outlined, we live in a very different society</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node11">the green belt isn't necessarily a thing</span> ... <span class="highlighted" id="node16">it's manmade</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node21">it's created by humans</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node26">Who's to say we can't tear it up and remake a different policy better-suited to our needs?</span><br>Tom Fyans:	Well, <span class="highlighted" id="node58">you can</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node67">that's what developers are arguing all the time</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node74">The only people, as I say who actually argue for development on the green belt are developers</span>, who <span class="highlighted" id="node81">actually want to increase their profit margins</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node88">Common sense says you don't want to pay for the countryside next door to where most of your urban population live</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node95">developers do want to tear it up</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node102">it's a constraint</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node113">It's been a very successful constraint</span>.<br>Poppy Cleary:	<span class="highlighted" id="node124">If it's a constraint, shouldn't we take away the constraint that should stop affordable houses being built in the right places?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node132">It's not just about creating the homes for people who want them, but they need to be in the right area</span>.<br>Tom Fyans:	<span class="highlighted" id="node143">I would love that to be the right case in some ways</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node150">we don't have a housing market that's delivering affordable homes</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node159">back to the land issue, developers want the green belt</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node166">it's cheap</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node177">They're not bothered by the environmental benefits that we have as users when we use it</span>.<br>Poppy Cleary:	But <span class="highlighted" id="node192">if the green belt is cheap, than certainly by opening up the entire area, you're gonna create the idea and the ability to create affordable homes in that area</span>.<br>Tom Fyans:	<span class="highlighted" id="node199">If we had a house building sector that could build houses</span> ... <span class="highlighted" id="node206">we've built less than 200 thousand homes a year consistently for the last 10, 20 years</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node213">We're just not building the houses</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node224">There's a constraint in supply</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node235">often intentionally by some of the developers</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node246">there's a skill shortage</span> and <span class="highlighted" id="node251">there's a material shortage</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node268">There is just not the model at the moment</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node275">Councils are not allowed to borrow money to build social or affordable housing</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node280">We've got a problem</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node300">I'm not disputing we've got a serious affordability problem</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node311">it's not really the green belt is often the easy bogeyman</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node318">it's just not true</span>.<br>Poppy Cleary:	<span class="highlighted" id="node329">Do you not think that if you opened up the green belt area that is so valuable to many people, that the housing market would adapt itself to enable affordable houses to be built in the areas that people want to live in?</span><br>Tom Fyans:	<span class="highlighted" id="node336">I don't think so</span>. I think <span class="highlighted" id="node347">when you get planning permission on a piece of land, it goes up in value about 300 times</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node358">That's a land market problem that we've got</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node369">that's an economic problem</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node380">Communities don't benefit from that</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node393">The landowner does</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node407">then the developer does by then building unaffordable houses</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node418">Community don't benefit at all</span>, which is why <span class="highlighted" id="node429">you don't get that support for that type of housing in communities across the country at the moment</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	Tom Fyans, thank you very much indeed.<br>Tom Fyans:	Thank you.<br><br>
