Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node1">Second witness, Tom Fyans</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">George ... I mean all our witnesses had powerful arguments and well-organised arguments</span> ... <span class="highlighted" id="node11">Tom Fyans' argument was centred on that there's a moral value to landscape, above and beyond human utility</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node16">Is that something you would take issue with</span>?<br>George Buskell:	<span class="highlighted" id="node30">Yeah</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node47">I mean we would have to place moral importance on elements of landscape</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node58">People obviously get a lot of enjoyment out of countryside</span>. T<span class="highlighted" id="node63">he issue is when there are genuine human needs, like development and infrastructure, they need to be taken into account first</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node76">The argument I suppose that would resonate with a lot of people that Tom Fyans made</span> was that<span class="highlighted" id="node81"> actually green belt was made as attractive to developers</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node86">it's cheap to build on</span>, not because <span class="highlighted" id="node91">it's the only place where you can build homes</span>.<br>George Buskell:<span class="highlighted" id="node118">	If it is truly the case that developers only want to build on the green belt because it's cheap and because they want to increase their profit margins</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node129">that's obviously a problem</span> and<span class="highlighted" id="node134"> we should look to other places</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node156">if it turns out to be the easiest and simplest solution to the problem</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node161">the problem at hand is big</span>, and<span class="highlighted" id="node166"> it's getting worse</span>. And so, <span class="highlighted" id="node171">perhaps we may have to look at the cheapest and easiest solution</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	And <span class="highlighted" id="node192">Jane, his argument that, you know, if it wasn't for the green belt that Faversham would be on the outer ends of L.A., is that ... actually, that sounds rather attractive, come to think of it</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node199">no, no, no. No.</span><br><span class="highlighted" id="node211">Jane Fidge</span>:	No, I think <span class="highlighted" id="node222">that's a very powerful point</span>. Because I think that, really,<span class="highlighted" id="node233"> when you go on the train from Faversham and you go up to London ... when you're sitting in that train, you don't really appreciate what you're going past</span>. But <span class="highlighted" id="node244">this is miles and miles and miles of greenfield</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node251">we would surely notice that, if that was all buildings</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node258">We would look out the window, and this sounds such a stupid point, but it would make train journeys so boring, if all you ever see out the window is the same thing over and over</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node269">And Poppy, somebody said "what's wrong with urban sprawl?"</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node274">What is wrong with urban sprawl</span>?<br>Poppy Cleary:	<span class="highlighted" id="node283">I don't think there is anything wrong with urban sprawl</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node299">Like one of the witnesses outlined, if we didn't have the green belt than Faversham would be part of London</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node304">that's great</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node309">I'd love that</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node314">I think that would be beneficial to people</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node325">I think that city growth and the growth of areas where people want to live is important</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node330">it's a benefit to humanity</span>.
