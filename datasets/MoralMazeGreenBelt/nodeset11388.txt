Michael Buerk:	Okay. So <span class="highlighted" id="node1">let's now turn to our established panel</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node6">Affluent, well-heeled, old golf club member, Claire Fox</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node13">How's your chipping these days</span>?<br>Claire Fox:	But look. <span class="highlighted" id="node20">An interesting example of the dilemma we've got is that one of the panel made</span> the point of, you know, <span class="highlighted" id="node27">when you're in your hospital bed, nature is valuable for humans</span> because <span class="highlighted" id="node34">you look out and see</span>, you know ...<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node45">That was Maddie</span>, I think.<br>Claire Fox:	<span class="highlighted" id="node52">Yes, Maddie</span>. That ... <span class="highlighted" id="node61">great point</span>. And <span class="highlighted" id="node68">that's a wonderful way to think of nature</span>. And then I think ... but what I would say is, <span class="highlighted" id="node75">I want to be able to build the hospital</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node80">I want to be able to create antibiotics</span>, and to be honest with you, <span class="highlighted" id="node85">I want a cure that's beyond looking out the window at the field</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node90">The field is a nice thing that we as humans might add</span>, but <span class="highlighted" id="node95">it's very low down the pecking order of, in my sense, a sense of priorities</span>.<br>	So I suppose that <span class="highlighted" id="node100">what I wanted to get over today is not that I despise the beauty of nature</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node105">although we've established that just 'cos the green belt's called "green" it's not necessarily beautiful greenery</span>, but it's also the case that I think <span class="highlighted" id="node110">we are above and beyond nature</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node115">Nature is now at our service</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node120">that's it's great beauty</span>.<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node173">Matthew</span>?<br>Matthew Taylor:	And <span class="highlighted" id="node180">one of the things about human being should be our capacity for imagination</span>. And what I found very disappointing in <span class="highlighted" id="node192">the arguments that we heard from Shiv Malik and Tobey Lloyd was a kind of lack of imagination</span>. You know, they're ... <span class="highlighted" id="node203">we could massively increase the density of our cities</span>. You know, <span class="highlighted" id="node214">as Jane said, there are 25 million empty bedrooms in our cities</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node234">We can have land taxes</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node245">There are all sorts of ways we could accommodate more people in better cities without having to damage nature</span>. And you know ... and yet ... <span class="highlighted" id="node274">why is nature the victim of the human failure of our planning policy</span>? <span class="highlighted" id="node279">Why don't we have human solutions to human problems</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node284"> rather than saying "Well because we can't resolve this</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node293">because we can't resolve inequality</span>, because <span class="highlighted" id="node302">we can't make developers more imaginative</span> ... well, <span class="highlighted" id="node311">it's the green belt that has to suffer for our failure</span>".<br>Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node353">Anne McElvoy has the answer to that question</span>.<br>Anne McElvoy:	Well, I thought <span class="highlighted" id="node360">it was an interesting example of where there was a conflation, really, between what the green belt</span> was - <span class="highlighted" id="node367">is it symbolic</span>, or <span class="highlighted" id="node372">is it really a thing in itself</span>? And I thought <span class="highlighted" id="node381">what we had tonight was an argument which we started out talking about whether the green belt was full of golf courses</span> or <span class="highlighted" id="node386">this marvellous bit of nature that Goethe would have celebrated, had he been around now</span>.
