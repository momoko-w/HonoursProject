You say <span id="node6" class="highlighted">the sooner the West steps in, or anybody does, the sooner you will have a unified command</span>, but <span id="node17" class="highlighted">you only have a unified command if the West imposes its ideas of what such a command should be</span>, so again, <span id="node22" class="highlighted">you are looking to foreign intervention to create the opposition, shape the opposition</span>, and<span id="node27" class="highlighted"> not to the Syrian people to do so</span>.<br><br><br>AN: Well, then that means <span id="node53" class="highlighted">we shouldn't look at the foreign intervention necessarily as the kind of intervention where the governments will pick sides and will pick allies with themselves</span>, <span id="node65" class="highlighted">that means the Western governments have to rethink the way they intervene</span>, <span id="node60" class="highlighted">they have to intervene in the sense of protecting lives regardless of their agendas</span>, so basically <span id="node70" class="highlighted">that should even stop them from having their agenda and try to support one group over the other</span>. <br><br>
