MB: Medhi Hasan, thank you very much indeed. Let's review what we have heard and see what we make of it. Our first witness, the first point, Michael Portillo, was that <span id="node6" class="highlighted">the UN's preoccupation with sovereignty is now really out of date, that it's now a protection of life, that's more the overriding consideration</span>. <span id="node15" class="highlighted">Would you accept that</span>?<br><br><br>MP: <span id="node22" class="highlighted">Sovereignty has been pushed aside</span>, <span id="node29" class="highlighted">it's something that we scarcely give any concern to at all</span>, but<span id="node40" class="highlighted"> I think that has been a great mistake</span>. As I said to you in my opening remarks, <span id="node48" class="highlighted">I thought pretty long and hard about intervening in the sovereignty of Bosnia</span>. In the end, <span id="node58" class="highlighted">I thought it was justified in that case and I tonne think so</span>. But <span id="node63" class="highlighted">I certainly didn't intend that it should become a kind of overriding principle</span> and <span id="node68" class="highlighted">I think we now intervene in places without even a concern for the issue of sovereignty</span>.<span id="node73" class="highlighted"> I really don't remember the issue of sovereignty being raised, say, in the case of Libya</span>, and <span id="node78" class="highlighted">I think it should preoccupy us</span>, because <span id="node83" class="highlighted">when we decide to intervene in another country, that is a big decision</span> and <span id="node88" class="highlighted">I think we have to have a lot of justification to do so</span>.
