MB: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> Panel, thanks very much indeed. </span> 
<span id="node6" class="highlighted"> Our first witness is Anas Nader, who is a spokesman for the London-based pressure group Friends of Syria </span> . 
<span id="node13" class="highlighted"> Which presumably in this context means enemies of Assad </span> . 
<span id="node20" class="highlighted"> Why should, in your view, the West have a moral responsibility to intervene in Syria </span> ? <br>

 

AN: Well, <span id="node27" class="highlighted"> I'll base my reasoning on the actual foundation of the UN </span> , 
<span id="node34" class="highlighted"> the UN was founded with this mandate to protect sovereignty </span> , but 
<span id="node41" class="highlighted"> that was based on the moral reasoning, that sovereignty, protecting sovereignty would protect lives </span> and 
<span id="node46" class="highlighted"> the UN was formed right after world war one and two, where the main cause of death, genocide and war crimes were international wars between nation </span> , but 
<span id="node51" class="highlighted"> that has changed over the past few decades </span> and 
<span id="node56" class="highlighted"> the number one reason for death and war crimes in conflicts is civil war and regimes </span> - <br>

 

MB: So you are saying <span id="node19" class="highlighted"> the moral basis for your case is to protect human life </span> ? <br>

 

AN: <span id="node126" class="highlighted"> To protect human life </span> , <span id="node131" class="highlighted"> absolutely </span> . <br>

 

MB: Claire Fox? <br>

 CF: <span id="node50" class="highlighted"> Can I explore that as a moral principle </span> ? <span id="node57" class="highlighted"> It seemed a little thin to me </span> . <span id="node62" class="highlighted"> Is it a cost benefit analysis situation </span> ? <span id="node67" class="highlighted"> Does it depend how many people are killed, the level of brutality </span> ? <br>

 AN: Well, <span id="node72" class="highlighted"> it depends on all the other methods tried to stop that </span> , so basically <span id="node89" class="highlighted"> diplomacy was tried for over a year and a half in Syria </span> , <span id="node94" class="highlighted"> and other forms of pressure </span> . <br>

 CF: I suppose I would just - <span id="node2" class="highlighted"> if you look at something like Iraq, for example, more civilians were killed in the war to get rid of Saddam Hussein than he actually killed civilians </span> . So <span id="node7" class="highlighted"> what does that mean </span> ? <br>

 AN: Absolutely, <span id="node110" class="highlighted"> I'm not supportive of intervention in Iraq </span> . <br>

 CF: So <span id="node36" class="highlighted"> you count how many bodies there were then </span> ? <br>

 AN: You count as - <span id="node43" class="highlighted"> when the coalition intervened in I shall rack, at the point they - Iraq, at the point they intervened, there wasn't really massacres going on </span> , <span id="node48" class="highlighted"> there was police brutality </span> . CF: You made an interesting point when you said that <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> the reason for, you know, any moral support for sovereignty was because of the numbers of people it would protect in terms of numbers </span> , but I mean, <span id="node10" class="highlighted"> there was a bit more to it than that </span> . <span id="node40" class="highlighted"> The whole concept of freedom </span> and <span id="node45" class="highlighted"> moral agency </span> , <span id="node22" class="highlighted"> determining one's own life </span> , <span id="node27" class="highlighted"> sovereignty had a bit more to it than just kind of like, we're looking after people and stopping them being killed </span> . <span id="node77" class="highlighted"> Aren't you ditching that at your peril </span> ? <br>

 AN: <span id="node94" class="highlighted"> One's own life, that's what the Syrian uprising was all about </span> , the right to demand - <br>

 CF: <span id="node101" class="highlighted"> So self-determination is inevitably undermined </span> , is it not, <span id="node108" class="highlighted"> if you can only have it delivered by external forces </span> , <span id="node120" class="highlighted"> why don't you allow the Syrian people the opportunity to forge their own freedom </span> ? <br>

 AN: <span id="node127" class="highlighted"> They are trying to </span> , but <span id="node132" class="highlighted"> there's already some form of intervention </span> when <span id="node137" class="highlighted"> Russia, Iran and China are supporting </span> and <span id="node142" class="highlighted"> are arming the Syrian regime </span> . And in a sense, <span id="node188" class="highlighted"> this is what the majority of people are asking, they are asking for that support </span> <br>

 CF: To claim the majority of the Syrian people, let's maybe go on to that, <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> is there a danger, particularly in the West, that we turn these things into morally easy - the good guys over here and the bad guys over there </span> . <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> We all know Assad is a bad guy </span> , but <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> the Syrian opposition is not so straightforwardly the Syrian people and national liberation struggle </span> . <span id="node16" class="highlighted"> They are fragmented </span> . <span id="node21" class="highlighted"> Who the hell are you going to be supporting if you go in and say, I'll take that side </span> ? <br>

 AN: <span id="node26" class="highlighted"> In many ways, they are fragmented </span> because <span id="node31" class="highlighted"> they are not being supported </span> . <br>

 CF: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> They squabble amongst themselves </span> , <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> they are not sure what it is - you will know that yourself </span> . <br>

 AN: <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> I agree with you </span> , <span id="node16" class="highlighted"> obviously they are working in separate smaller groups, </span> but <span id="node70" class="highlighted"> it's kind of important to know that if the intervention happens sooner than later, then some sort of a unified command and control would have been in place for these rebels </span> . KM: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> You have talked about intervention to prevent massacres </span> , but <span id="node62" class="highlighted"> would you accept that the earlier the West gets involved and intervenes, the more of a voice it will have in the post Assad Syria, the more it will be able to direct post Assad governments towards Western friendly postures </span> . <br>

 AN: Well, in a sense, <span id="node21" class="highlighted"> that might be true, but I don't think it's necessarily the case all the time </span> . <span id="node26" class="highlighted"> I think it could end up being more of a partnership </span> . There would be more - <span id="node31" class="highlighted"> they would have more of a ground to negotiate with a new government, with a more Western friendly government </span> , but <span id="node36" class="highlighted"> that doesn't obviously guarantee one or two election terms that would be always the case </span> , and <span id="node41" class="highlighted"> that shouldn't be the reason anyway for the intervention </span> , <span id="node46" class="highlighted"> the intervention should be on more moral grounds </span> , <span id="node51" class="highlighted"> protecting lives, regardless of what government we get, whether it's West friendly or not </span> . <br>

 KM: You say <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> that shouldn't be the reason </span> , but in a sense <span id="node10" class="highlighted"> that's what many groups want, they want different foreign powers to intervene in order to get their support in a post Assad Syria </span> . <br>

 AN: <span id="node22" class="highlighted"> You mean many groups from within Syria </span> ? <br>

 KM: <span id="node29" class="highlighted"> Within Syria </span> . <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> What I'm trying to get at is what the consequences of intervention would be </span> , <span id="node12" class="highlighted"> you've already talked about divisions within the opposition </span> , <span id="node17" class="highlighted"> for instance the free Syrian army and the Syrian national council are deeply divided </span> , <span id="node22" class="highlighted"> the Syrian national council is deeply divided </span> . <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> Which faction, if the West intervenes, should the West support </span> ? <br>

 AN: <span id="node41" class="highlighted"> That was the beginning, but recently the Syrian national council and the free Syrian army have been working together and co-operatically closely together </span> . <span id="node53" class="highlighted"> They are serving different purposes </span> . <span id="node66" class="highlighted"> The Syrian national council is a political pressure group that could help form the nucleus of a transition government </span> , but <span id="node77" class="highlighted"> the army is purely the militant arm or wing of the actual uprising revolution </span> so <span id="node88" class="highlighted"> I don't think they necessarily have to be one or the other </span> , so <span id="node115" class="highlighted"> I think the sooner we step in, the sooner the regional countries, like Turkey, steps in and supports them more openly, it would help provide more of a unified command and control, rather than working in small battalions, and prevent some of the mess in the future </span> . <span id="node103" class="highlighted"> We have to understand that with or without intervention, the war is going to carry on, the people are going to carry on fighting that regime and holding arms </span> , but <span id="node108" class="highlighted"> the sooner we help and support, the less messy it will get </span> . <br>

 KM: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> That is an interesting argument </span> . You say <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> the sooner the West steps in, or anybody does, the sooner you will have a unified command </span> , but <span id="node17" class="highlighted"> you only have a unified command if the West imposes its ideas of what such a command should be </span> , so again, <span id="node22" class="highlighted"> you are looking to foreign intervention to create the opposition, shape the opposition </span> , and <span id="node27" class="highlighted"> not to the Syrian people to do so </span> . <br>

 AN: Well, then that means <span id="node53" class="highlighted"> we shouldn't look at the foreign intervention necessarily as the kind of intervention where the governments will pick sides and will pick allies with themselves </span> , <span id="node65" class="highlighted"> that means the Western governments have to rethink the way they intervene </span> , <span id="node60" class="highlighted"> they have to intervene in the sense of protecting lives regardless of their agendas </span> , so basically <span id="node70" class="highlighted"> that should even stop them from having their agenda and try to support one group over the other </span> . <br>

 MB: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> Thank you very much indeed </span> . <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> Our next witness is Karl Sharro, who was actually an architect but is also a writer and commentator on Middle Eastern politics </span> , <span id="node13" class="highlighted"> he has himself a Lebanese and Iraqi background but family and friends in Syria itself </span> . <span id="node20" class="highlighted"> What in your view does the West really mean when it talks of a moral responsibility to intervene in the region </span> ? <br>

 KS: <span id="node27" class="highlighted"> <span id="node28" class="highlighted"> I think in the case of Syria it is a very specific response </span> </span> because <span id="node33" class="highlighted"> we are getting on the one hand a sort of moral projection and projecting the West as this kind of agent that acts purely on moral considerations </span> , while in fact <span id="node38" class="highlighted"> there is probably very little evidence of any actual intervention happening </span> , so <span id="node43" class="highlighted"> it's kind of the apex of this using interventionism abroad to boost </span> - <br>

 MB: <span id="node53" class="highlighted"> You reckon the West is assuming some false moral superiority, is that your </span> - <br>

 KS: <span id="node58" class="highlighted"> I would say there are two main problems on the principled moral level with the idea of Western intervention for moral reason </span> . <span id="node63" class="highlighted"> One is there is this assumption of moral superiority </span> and <span id="node68" class="highlighted"> the other is the lack of consistency in the record of Western governments in kind of projecting that sense of moral authority </span> . <br>

 CL: Can I ask you this, <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> is it there a level of atrocity in Syria by the Assad regime that would persuade you to change your mind </span> ? <br>

 KS: <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> I don't come to this with a distant abstract kind of approach </span> , <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> it is not that I am cold to the atrocities that are happening over there </span> , and <span id="node16" class="highlighted"> quite frankly it has been happening for a year and a half </span> and <span id="node21" class="highlighted"> we have grown sadly accustomed to the level of atrocities </span> , but <span id="node26" class="highlighted"> we have in these moments, that's where we have to draw on our moral strength and convictions </span> . <br>

 CL: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> I would like to know how you are thinking about where it goes from here </span> . <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> Supposing it got twice or ten times as bad </span> . <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> At some point, would you say enough is enough </span> ? <br>

 KS: <span id="node24" class="highlighted"> That is the calculus of death that distorts any understanding </span> . <br>

 CL: <span id="node35" class="highlighted"> Do we have to do that </span> ? <br>

 KS: <span id="node42" class="highlighted"> No, not at all </span> . <span id="node47" class="highlighted"> That's a false assumption </span> , and <span id="node52" class="highlighted"> circulated to kind of make the argument seem morally superior </span> , when in fact <span id="node57" class="highlighted"> it's not considered at all </span> and <span id="node62" class="highlighted"> it's not taking into consideration the full moral context and the political context in which these decisions have to be taken </span> . <br>

 CL: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> In terms of broad moral principles, is the basic premise behind the responsibility to protect the United Nations moral </span> ? <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> Do you think it should not have been passed </span> ? <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> Do you claim it </span> , or <span id="node16" class="highlighted"> do you reject it </span> ? <br>

 KS: <span id="node27" class="highlighted"> If it is up to me, I would abolish the United Nations entirely </span> and putting that aside, <span id="node34" class="highlighted"> no, it shouldn't have been passed </span> , because a kind of - <span id="node41" class="highlighted"> it assumes certain assumptions that (a) the world and international relations and politics operate according to moral principles </span> . However, <span id="node52" class="highlighted"> we are only keen to express those moral principles by bombing other nations </span> . <span id="node83" class="highlighted"> It doesn't for example apply to the case of immigrants coming from Africa, who we callously close our borders to </span> , <span id="node88" class="highlighted"> there the moral principle doesn't apply, even though that involves death, people coming to Europe </span> , but it's convenient - <br>

 CL: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> Many moral positions you would take I would agree with </span> , so <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> there isn't a great chasm between us </span> , but what I am saying is <span id="node17" class="highlighted"> if it's possible to stop atrocities going on, don't we have a duty to do so </span> ? <br>

 KS: <span id="node24" class="highlighted"> The problem I think is a lack of context and a lack of understanding </span> , <span id="node29" class="highlighted"> previous action of Western governments, actually now we are asking to intervene in creating the situation at the moment </span> , of course <span id="node34" class="highlighted"> I can't respond to a very kind of severed formulation of what the situation is </span> . <br>

 

MP: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> Do you mind if I take you away from Syria to Bosnia </span> ? <span id="node49" class="highlighted"> I
mean networks that case, we saw 8,000 men murdered in Srebrenica, we
intervened, NATO intervened, the killing then ceased, I don't think another
life was lost in combat </span> . <span id="node31" class="highlighted"> Was that not morally justified and successful </span> ? <br>

 <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> We are talking about Syria - that is not what we are doing on this programme </span> . <br>

 MP: <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> What we are doing on this programme is we're trying to get to the moral principle </span> , so <span id="node52" class="highlighted"> if you're against the intervention in Syria, we want to know whether that is for moral reasons </span> or <span id="node27" class="highlighted"> for circumstances that are particular to Syria </span> . <br>

 KS: <span id="node32" class="highlighted"> I am against intervention on moral principle </span> , I am against the - <span id="node37" class="highlighted"> the moral principle involved is highly distorted and doesn't understand what the real significance of the struggle for self-determination and freedom is </span> . It's sort of infantilising to our - <br>

 MP: <span id="node42" class="highlighted"> That sounds as if it's particular to Syria again </span> . <br>

 KS: <span id="node47" class="highlighted"> It's a broad principle </span> . <br>

 MP: So <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> on your broad principle, when 800,000Tutsis were murdered in R want did a and nobody did anything about it in 1994, it was morally correct not to intervene and allow that genocide to occur </span> ? <br>

 KS: Again, <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> I think that is a form of distraction for you to throw me into areas that I neither have the detailed historic knowledge of </span> , <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> in order to draw out the considerations that we are looking at </span> . <br>

 MP: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> I am not challenging you on - ah, go on </span> . <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> You are sure there are cases </span> ? <br>

 KS: If I may continue, <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> I am sure there are cases which warrant forms of interventions that I would probably subscribe to </span> . <span id="node16" class="highlighted"> Morality doesn't exist in isolation of political context </span> and <span id="node21" class="highlighted"> that's the problem, in formulating this in a sort of high school type abstracted completely denude </span> - <br>

 MP: <span id="node26" class="highlighted"> I am not trying to do that </span> . <span id="node31" class="highlighted"> I am trying to take you to real example which have happened in history </span> , and you are saying <span id="node68" class="highlighted"> you don't know the history so you can't answer me </span> , and then you say <span id="node79" class="highlighted"> I am like a schoolboy </span> . <br>

 KS: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> I am kind of shocked by your inability to talk about the specificities of Syria </span> . <br>

 MP: <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> What I am talking about is the specificity of the morality </span> , <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> which is the programme you have been invited on to </span> . <br>

 KS: I take that on board, but again I say <span id="node16" class="highlighted"> the principle would for me have to meet two conditions for the side that would actually intervene </span> . One <span id="node67" class="highlighted"> that it's moral authority is drawn from a genuine sense of moral authority, that there's universal consensus on </span> , and <span id="node72" class="highlighted"> not merely the fact that we have the big guns </span> , and <span id="node77" class="highlighted"> a sense of consistency in projecting that sense of moral authority in cases where other people need it </span> . <span id="node31" class="highlighted"> Both conditions are not met with the proposal for Western intervention in Syria </span> . MP: Let me comment that <span id="node2" class="highlighted"> your wish to achieve universality is undermined if you don't believe in the United Nations </span> . <span id="node7" class="highlighted"> How do you determine it </span> ? <br>

 KS: The simple answer to that is <span id="node12" class="highlighted"> you and I both understand the lack of equality within the United Nations </span> and <span id="node47" class="highlighted"> the mere presence of the United Nations Security Council </span> and <span id="node52" class="highlighted"> the veto power for the five major nation that have the big guns again distorts all of that understanding </span> , i <span id="node22" class="highlighted"> t's kind of rides over any notions of sovereignty and healthy understanding of moral autonomy and national self-determination </span> , so <span id="node32" class="highlighted"> it's absolutely a distortion of moral principle which by the way, as I understand it, through the legacy of the enlightenment, I'm not coming to this with cultural relativism </span> . <br>

 MB: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> Okay, thank you very much indeed </span> . <span id="node16" class="highlighted"> Our next witness is Dr Alan Mendoza, who is executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, which is a think tank that promotes the spread of liberal democracy </span> . <span id="node23" class="highlighted"> An overriding moral obligation to intervene </span> ? <br>

 AM: <span id="node30" class="highlighted"> I think absolutely </span> . <span id="node44" class="highlighted"> If we're looking at the Syrian case, I think we have certainly reached the point where you have a dictator who has demonstrated his wish and indeed his willingness to carry out mass atrocities and will continue to do so </span> . KM: <span id="node2" class="highlighted"> Your argument is the West should intervene to prevent the massacres that are now taking place </span> and <span id="node7" class="highlighted"> then leave the Syrians to decide their own futures </span> . <br>

 AM: <span id="node14" class="highlighted"> There are several forms of intervention, and I'm not sure which sort you're suggesting </span> . <br>

 KM: <span id="node25" class="highlighted"> You are the one who is suggesting it </span> . <br>

 AM: <span id="node36" class="highlighted"> Let me give you an example </span> . <span id="node41" class="highlighted"> You can go from the very basic of arming the rebels, hoping they will take things into their own hands </span> , <span id="node46" class="highlighted"> as we did partly with Libya for example </span> . <span id="node86" class="highlighted"> You can go to interdiction, safe areas </span> , <span id="node91" class="highlighted"> all things we've seen in previous interventions </span> , or <span id="node56" class="highlighted"> if all else fails and you feel it is warranted and if there is international agreement on it, to military intervention of some kind </span> , but <span id="node61" class="highlighted"> there is a whole raft of ways to get there </span> . KM: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> What I am getting at is this distinction that you seem to be drawing between the idea of intervention to prevent massacres, to prevent bloodshed now </span> , and <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> the leaving of the Syrian people to decide their own futures post intervention, if you like </span> . <span id="node13" class="highlighted"> What I'm wondering is how plausible is that scenario </span> ? After all, <span id="node20" class="highlighted"> isn't the very process of intervening to shape the decisions of Syrian people to their future </span> , especially <span id="node25" class="highlighted"> given the Friends of Syria want the West to intervene in order to shape - create a more Western friendly government post Assad </span> . <br>

 AM: <span id="node42" class="highlighted"> I don't know if the Friends of Syria want the west to intervene </span> , <span id="node47" class="highlighted"> they want the international community to intervene </span> , and <span id="node52" class="highlighted"> part of their argument is to get round the block that Russia and China have put on it </span> . <span id="node57" class="highlighted"> The Arab world support Syria right now </span> . <span id="node62" class="highlighted"> In Libya, we have recently seen an intervention that was supported across the border in many, many countries, not just the west but beyond </span> . <span id="node67" class="highlighted"> What happened, we went in and supported the rebels </span> , <span id="node72" class="highlighted"> we then left and the Libyan people have demonstrated this week their own future, they have taken that into their own control </span> . <br>

 KM: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> We might come back to that </span> , but <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> I want to pursue this idea of intervention </span> . <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> Would you agree that liberal democracy is morally superior to dictatorships, authoritarian regimes, Islamist government and so on </span> ? <br>

 AM: <span id="node20" class="highlighted"> Absolutely </span> . <span id="node29" class="highlighted"> Liberal democracy is the ultimate form of government as far as we're concerned </span> . That said, <span id="node40" class="highlighted"> it's very important, very cognisant to take what happens in each country after - or whenever there is an election or some attempt to enforce free will </span> , <span id="node47" class="highlighted"> you cannot force democracy on people </span> , <span id="node58" class="highlighted"> that is very important to note </span> , <span id="node63" class="highlighted"> you can't do that </span> . <span id="node68" class="highlighted"> It is the ultimate form of government </span> , because <span id="node73" class="highlighted"> it provides freedom of the individual and expression of choice </span> . <span id="node84" class="highlighted"> Any other form of government that doesn't inherently discriminates in some way, shape or form </span> . <br>

 KM: <span id="node113" class="highlighted"> I would agree with you on that, on both points </span> . <br>

 But my point is this: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> if foreign powers intervene in Syria, if there is a possibility of a nondemocratic, another authoritarian, another dictator, another Islamist government </span> , <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> doesn't it make sense, in your view, to continue to intervene to shape that future </span> , <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> so there aren't, for instance, more massacres in the future, imposed by an authoritarian government </span> ? <br>

 AM: <span id="node24" class="highlighted"> If you look at two recent examples of governmental changes in the Middle East, it is quite interesting what has happened </span> . <span id="node29" class="highlighted"> Let's look at Libya, the West intervened quite rightly to stop atrocities and then Libya determined its future </span> , <span id="node34" class="highlighted"> yes it's unclear, but at the moment things are looking positive in terms of how Libyans have embraced that opportunity and gone forward </span> . <span id="node39" class="highlighted"> If you compare that with Egypt, where the West didn't intervene, if you look at what has happened there at the government that has emerged, and also the percentage of people voting there </span> , <span id="node44" class="highlighted"> I think you will see that the very act of intervention itself leads to greater participation </span> - <br>

 KM: <span id="node49" class="highlighted"> Would you have preferred the west to intervene in Egypt? </span> <br>

 AM: <span id="node54" class="highlighted"> They continent. Different case in point </span> . <br>

 CF: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> I so want to argue with you about whether Libya is a success story </span> , but <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> it will distract us </span> , <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> people will recognise it's not such a rosy picture </span> . <span id="node16" class="highlighted"> It's interesting you raise Russia and China </span> , and people have said <span id="node52" class="highlighted"> it's incomprehensible and inconceivable that these countries would oppose this, based on their self-interest </span> . <span id="node26" class="highlighted"> Isn't the kind of realpolitik and self-interest there actually part of a fairly principled reason why you would have a foreign policy </span> ? <br>

 MB: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> Thank you very much indeed </span> . <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> Our last witness, Medhi Hasan, formerly political editor of the New Statesman now on a similar position at the huffing tonne post website </span> . <span id="node13" class="highlighted"> On the basis of recent experience, how difficult do you think is it to construct a plausible humanitarian case for Western military intervention </span> ? <br>

 MH: <span id="node20" class="highlighted"> It's a very difficult question, and a very important discussion </span> . <span id="node27" class="highlighted"> I think there is a very strong case for doing something in Syria </span> , <span id="node32" class="highlighted"> <span id="node33" class="highlighted"> I am not someone who says you should do nothing </span> </span> , <span id="node38" class="highlighted"> we shouldn't be isolationist </span> , <span id="node43" class="highlighted"> we have to stop the killing machine </span> , but <span id="node49" class="highlighted"> <span id="node48" class="highlighted"> I just think these calls, as we have heard on the programme already, for arming rebels and safe havens and taking full military intervention </span> I think will only worsen the situation </span> , <span id="node54" class="highlighted"> we will simply be pouring petrol on the flames </span> , <span id="node59" class="highlighted"> we will be intensifying the conflict when we should be trying to demilitarise what is a fully fledged civil war now </span> . <br>

 MP: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> Let me take you away from Syria a bit </span> , because <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> it sounds as if you are somebody who would accept intervention in certain cases </span> . <br>

 MH: <span id="node17" class="highlighted"> Very limited cases </span> . <span id="node24" class="highlighted"> I start from the premise that I am sceptical of military intervention </span> . <br>

 MP: And <span id="node31" class="highlighted"> in the case of Syria, there are all sorts of difficulties about it </span> , <span id="node38" class="highlighted"> it is quite a long way, a powerful regime </span> . <br>

 MH: And <span id="node50" class="highlighted"> moral issues </span> . <br>

 MP: And <span id="node61" class="highlighted"> the killing has not been so great as in other areas </span> . <span id="node62" class="highlighted"> If this was a straightforward case of ethnic genocide, with a million being killed, one people wiping out another, would we be justified in intervening </span> ? <br>

 MH: <span id="node13" class="highlighted"> I would be much more inclined towards supporting such an intervention </span> , but <span id="node18" class="highlighted"> it would have to be in specific criteria </span> . Dr Alan Mendoza mentioned <span id="node23" class="highlighted"> responsibility to correct </span> , <span id="node32" class="highlighted"> that was laid out by the UN in 200 are 5, six criteria, very similar to last resort, reasonable authority, reasonable prospect of success, those criteria met, I think there is a case </span> . <span id="node37" class="highlighted"> The problem with our conflicts in recent years, you mentioned Rwanda and Bosnia, the problem is the conflicts we have had since then haven't met those criteria </span> . <span id="node42" class="highlighted"> They are never last resorts </span> , <span id="node47" class="highlighted"> they rarely have legal authority </span> , <span id="node52" class="highlighted"> they often tend to make matters worse, not better </span> , a <span id="node57" class="highlighted"> s we have seen in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya as well </span> . <br>

 MP: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> Does geography play a part? </span> <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> In the case of Rwanda, say a new case presents itself in Africa tomorrow, would it matter that it is quite a long way from here </span> and <span id="node18" class="highlighted"> would it be advantageous that the intervention should be done by African forces rather than European </span> ? <br>

 MH: <span id="node25" class="highlighted"> Let us take one of the criteria, a reasonable prospect of success </span> , <span id="node30" class="highlighted"> for that criteria, geography does matter </span> . <span id="node35" class="highlighted"> Even liberal interventionists now recognise that the West can't intervene willy nilly in places where we don't know much about it </span> . <span id="node45" class="highlighted"> In Lebanon, we were told the Arab League led the way by supporting us </span> , <span id="node50" class="highlighted"> that was seen as a crucial part </span> . MP: Yes, <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> if a Bosnia happened tomorrow in Europe, would we be justified in intervening </span> ? <br>

 MH: <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> I think yes </span> , and <span id="node16" class="highlighted"> after Bosnia, we had Kosovo and I'm one of these people who probably would have supported the Bosnia intervention, I was very young at the time, but looking back, I would support what happened in Bosnia </span> , <span id="node23" class="highlighted"> I didn't support Kosovo </span> , because <span id="node30" class="highlighted"> I didn't think the means were proportiona </span> l and <span id="node41" class="highlighted"> it didn't lead to success, but with reverse ethnic cleansing </span> . CL: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> In the initial question Michael asked you, he used the word western intervention </span> . <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> Is it a specific problem that the interventions we have been discussing are western </span> ? <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> Would it change your view if they weren't </span> ? <br>

 MH: <span id="node16" class="highlighted"> It is a specific problem in the way we tend to have the power and the places don't </span> . <span id="node21" class="highlighted"> It depends what conflict you are referring to </span> . <span id="node26" class="highlighted"> Unfortunately we can't take a universal approach </span> . <span id="node31" class="highlighted"> If you're in Afghanistan, there is a specific history involving the British for example that we totally forgot about, that we had been in four wars previously and lost most of them </span> . <span id="node36" class="highlighted"> In the Middle East there is a specific context, with American intervention, when it is seen as pushing an Israeli agenda </span> . CL: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> Including diplomacy </span> . <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> Doesn't that require at least in the background a threat of force for it to be effective </span> ? <br>

 MH: <span id="node13" class="highlighted"> Not on every occasion </span> , because <span id="node24" class="highlighted"> there are financial pressures </span> . For example, the pressure - <br>

 CL: <span id="node35" class="highlighted"> It isn't working </span> . <br>

 MH: <span id="node46" class="highlighted"> That doesn't mean it won't work, that's not an argument </span> . <span id="node57" class="highlighted"> I would argue, for example, in Syria, the best resolution of Syria is to get the Russians on board </span> . <span id="node62" class="highlighted"> Should we militarily threaten Russia </span> ? <br>

 CL: <span id="node73" class="highlighted"> I'm saying it isn't working </span> . <span id="node86" class="highlighted"> We are in a state of stalemate </span> . <br>

 MH: <span id="node97" class="highlighted"> But I don't think that means a diplomatic solution is not the solution </span> . Both of the Middle East experts say <span id="node110" class="highlighted"> the Annan plan for all its flaws is the only game in town, get both sides to lay down their arms and come round the table </span> . <span id="node125" class="highlighted"> In Afghanistan, we were told, we have to beat the Taliban, but actually we have to get round the table with them </span> . <br>

 CL: <span id="node136" class="highlighted"> That could involve innocent civilian deaths </span> turning the argument round, <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> are we not standing by while millions or hundreds of thousands of civilians have their lives threatened and tens of thousands are losing their lives </span> ? <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> Don't we have an obligation to intervene morally to prevent that </span> ? <br>

 MH: <span id="node13" class="highlighted"> I agree </span> , but <span id="node22" class="highlighted"> I would argue that I am more responsible for my action than my inaction </span> , so <span id="node36" class="highlighted"> if I am standing by having to watch two people fight and kill each other, it is worse if I intervene and kill them both </span> . <br>

 CL: But <span id="node47" class="highlighted"> you still think it right to intervene </span> ? <span id="node54" class="highlighted"> It's a good parallel </span> . <span id="node61" class="highlighted"> You should do your best, even though there might be adverse consequences </span> . <br>

 MH: <span id="node72" class="highlighted"> Not if I am trying to help one innocent person kill another innocent person's family </span> . <br>

 CL: <span id="node83" class="highlighted"> That's not what I'm proposing </span> . <br>

 MH: <span id="node94" class="highlighted"> It is </span> . <span id="node105" class="highlighted"> If in Syria we arm the HSA to prevent a Hola massacre, but if they take the weapons, I'm responsible for that </span> . <br>

 CL: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> Let's go to an abstract level </span> . <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> Supposing we had the power to stop Assad </span> . <br>

 MH: <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> That's the big if </span> . <br>

 CL: <span id="node16" class="highlighted"> Would we be right to do so </span> ? <br>

 MH: <span id="node46" class="highlighted"> If we had the power to stop Assad without intensifying the bloodshed, yes, we would be right to do so, but we don't, that's the key point you miss out </span> . <br>

 MB: Medhi Hasan, thank you very much indeed. Let's review what we have heard and see what we make of it. Our first witness, the first point, Michael Portillo, was that <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> the UN's preoccupation with sovereignty is now really out of date, that it's now a protection of life, that's more the overriding consideration </span> . <span id="node15" class="highlighted"> Would you accept that </span> ? <br>

 MP: <span id="node22" class="highlighted"> Sovereignty has been pushed aside </span> , <span id="node29" class="highlighted"> it's something that we scarcely give any concern to at all </span> , but <span id="node40" class="highlighted"> I think that has been a great mistake </span> . As I said to you in my opening remarks, <span id="node48" class="highlighted"> I thought pretty long and hard about intervening in the sovereignty of Bosnia </span> . In the end, <span id="node58" class="highlighted"> I thought it was justified in that case and I tonne think so </span> . But <span id="node63" class="highlighted"> I certainly didn't intend that it should become a kind of overriding principle </span> and <span id="node68" class="highlighted"> I think we now intervene in places without even a concern for the issue of sovereignty </span> . <span id="node73" class="highlighted"> I really don't remember the issue of sovereignty being raised, say, in the case of Libya </span> , and <span id="node78" class="highlighted"> I think it should preoccupy us </span> , because <span id="node83" class="highlighted"> when we decide to intervene in another country, that is a big decision </span> and <span id="node88" class="highlighted"> I think we have to have a lot of justification to do so </span> . MB: Claire, our first witness didn't seem to accept your argument that <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> intervention, reduced moral agency, reduced self-determination and was from that point of view a bad thing </span> . MB: Karl Sharro, our second witness, who had the virtue of being clear, his first point was that <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> the West was somehow assuming a moral superiority it didn't really have </span> . I must admit, I did ache to ask him if <span id="node10" class="highlighted"> a country at peace with itself with a democratic government and all the rest of it doesn't have actually some level of moral superiority over one where they are massacring each other in their thousands </span> . MB: I definitely want to take that point up a bit later, but Clifford Longley, <span id="node10" class="highlighted"> Karl Sharro did take your position head on, didn't he </span> ? He talked about, in a rather winning phase, <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> the calculus of death distorts moral judgment </span> . <br>

 CL: Because <span id="node17" class="highlighted"> he hadn't got an answer to my question </span> , and <span id="node22" class="highlighted"> if he had answered my question he would have to concede the case </span> , because t <span id="node27" class="highlighted"> here must be some level at which he can no longer condone inaction </span> . <span id="node32" class="highlighted"> We must all round this table recognise that if we were looking at for example another situation, Nazi Germany, killing Jews, we would have an absolute moral obligation to do everything in our power to prevent it </span> . <span id="node37" class="highlighted"> I don't see, in principle, this case is the same </span> . <br>

 CF: <span id="node64" class="highlighted"> I think this is very thin morality </span> . <span id="node75" class="highlighted"> You literally go, there's so many bodies over there, so that makes a stronger case than over here </span> . <span id="node86" class="highlighted"> If I believed that something ought to be done, I don't mean in terms of military intervention, but if something ought to be done, I hope I would be driven by some sense of principle </span> . <br>

 CL: But <span id="node104" class="highlighted"> proportionality is a perfectly good moral principle </span> . <br>

 CF: But <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> I think that is all that has been left. That's why we get confused </span> . <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> You get the news distorted by it, let's see if we can get people to kind of cry a lot, kind of get them emotive, show them lots of bodies </span> . <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> It becomes a very superficial way of wringing our hearts to get us to do something </span> . All I'm suggesting is that (a) <span id="node22" class="highlighted"> life is more complicated </span> , (b) <span id="node27" class="highlighted"> morality is more complicated </span> and it's just possible that just because <span id="node32" class="highlighted"> you're shocked by horror that you don't actually then go, oh, let's rush in then, because otherwise we are going to be immoral </span> . MB: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> What was interesting, in your views and the witnesses' views, where the dividing line was </span> . <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> Why Bosnia and arguably the lost opportunity in Rwanda were good and Iraq and maybe even Libya, if you took that view, were wrong </span> . <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> What was it </span> ? <span id="node16" class="highlighted"> Was it to do with numbers </span> ? <span id="node21" class="highlighted"> Was it due to an ethnic dimension </span> ? <span id="node26" class="highlighted"> Was it due to, you know, whether it was a plausible, practical operation </span> ? Michael, where did you put the needle in that graph? <br>

 MP: <span id="node41" class="highlighted"> Well, I think none of these really do amount to moral principles but the numbers are partly to do with it </span> , because <span id="node53" class="highlighted"> if the numbers are relatively small </span> , and <span id="node64" class="highlighted"> I'm sorry even to say they are relatively small in Syria </span> , because <span id="node69" class="highlighted"> it is thousands of people, but people understand that I am talking in the context of hundreds of thousands that have been killed elsewhere </span> , <span id="node80" class="highlighted"> if the numbers are relatively small it doesn't indicate genocide on the scale of Rwanda </span> , <span id="node98" class="highlighted"> it indicates a struggle </span> , and <span id="node109" class="highlighted"> a number of people have said the struggle is extremely complicated </span> . And <span id="node118" class="highlighted"> geography matters as well, certainly in practical terms </span> , <span id="node125" class="highlighted"> do we have the ability to get forces out there in order to do something about it </span> , but <span id="node136" class="highlighted"> it matters in a different sense, that our responsibility is first and foremost to ourselves and then to our neighbours </span> , and <span id="node143" class="highlighted"> that people in Bosnia are our neighbours in a way that people in Syria and people in Rwanda are not </span> . <br>

 CL: <span id="node154" class="highlighted"> That's not an acceptable distinction </span> , honestly, <span id="node165" class="highlighted"> morally, you can't get away with that </span> . <span id="node189" class="highlighted"> We are involved in all those people's affairs </span> , <span id="node194" class="highlighted"> they are all part of the same human race </span> , and <span id="node199" class="highlighted"> our interests are involved in those affairs </span> . <br>

 MB: What about Mr Sharro talking about, <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> if Syria, why not Bahrain, why not Saudi Arabia </span> ? <br>

 CL: <span id="node10" class="highlighted"> That is an absurd argument </span> . <span id="node21" class="highlighted"> If we can't put everything right, we shouldn't put anything right, that's what it amounts to </span> . <br>

 KM: <span id="node32" class="highlighted"> That's not the argument </span> . <span id="node43" class="highlighted"> I agree with you </span> , <span id="node80" class="highlighted"> just because you can't intervene everywhere doesn't mean you shouldn't, but what the argument points out is the selective nature of the intervention undermines the supposed moral claims for such intervention. That's what the argument is about </span> . <br>

 CF: <span id="node1" class="highlighted"> The problem is we end up with a foreign policy that can up and down, inconsistent, you can't work out where it's based </span> . <span id="node6" class="highlighted"> My concern is often the drive for foreign policy at the moment is to give a moral cause to the West </span> , <span id="node11" class="highlighted"> they haven't really got one </span> . <span id="node22" class="highlighted"> We're in a moral mess here </span> , <span id="node33" class="highlighted"> we're morally compromised at home </span> and <span id="node44" class="highlighted"> we look to a black and white simple solution, we'll go in and save those people, to give ourselves some moral drive </span> . <span id="node55" class="highlighted"> That's the wrong way to do it </span> . <br>

 MB: And the small kernel of argument you introduced at one stage, <span id="node62" class="highlighted"> self-interest necessarily immoral </span> ? <br>

 CF: <span id="node90" class="highlighted"> No, I think it can be very positive. We have demonised it </span> . <br>
