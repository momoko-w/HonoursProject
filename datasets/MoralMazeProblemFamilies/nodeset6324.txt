Anne McElvoy:	<span class="highlighted" id="node180">Is the problem that you
have with the State fundamentally that you think, philosophically,
that it shouldn’t intervene in the private sphere, in family life,
go into people’s homes – which I suppose Louise Casey’s
proposals would entail. Or is it that it’s just not very good at
it, and therefore it’s just not its role?

Alexander Brown:	<span class="highlighted" id="node35">I think it’s the
former</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node37">but I don’t want to suggest that there’s no role for the
State.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node39">The State can provide information, guidance, and assistance on
a voluntary basis.</span>

Anne McElvoy:<span class="highlighted" id="node68">	Well it can if they can
get it to the people who need it</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node70">but otherwise that’s no use.

Alexander Brown:	<span class="highlighted" id="node93">Well it depends on
what basis you think they need it, and why</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node95"> I do accept that there
are cases where families are harming themselves and harming others</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node97">
and then State intervention in that sense is needed.

Alexander Brown:	Well…
