you’re taking the first notion of what morality is</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node227"> I’m taking
the second</span>; <span class="highlighted" id="node233">that’s the distinction</span>.

Christian Guy:	<span class="highlighted" id="node249">No</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node9">I mean the CSJ is –
it has for years now looked at social reform across a number of
areas</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node11">I don’t see why it can’t be both;</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node13">you have to look at
personal choices and responsibility, and also the conditions you
create around families that lead to those decisions.
</span>
<br>


Kenan Malik:	I agree, but <span class="highlighted" id="node60">there are
many forms of state intervention</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node280"> It can provide jobs, build
affordable housing, provide decent leisure facilities, not close down
libraries or swimming pools and so on</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node291">Why is it, for you, that state
intervention only seems to be coercive state intervention in the
lives and families of the poor?</span>

<br>


Christian Guy:	<span class="highlighted" id="node121">It’s not coercive at
all</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node123">it’s about creating conditions for them to make their own
decisions</span>.

<br>


Kenan Malik:	<span class="highlighted" id="node125">Well I think they might
find it coercive.</span>

Christian Guy:	<span class="highlighted" id="node312">No</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node186">they actually want
help, </span><span class="highlighted" id="node178">and they respond well to the framework in which you give them
that help.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node333">So, for example, if you create a structure that says “Make
decisions about family structures in a way that you feel benefits
you”, but the state gives you a neutral level playing field, that’s
a great thing</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node344">At the moment it’s saying, “Split up, don’t form
couples”</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node355"> and that’s dangerous</span>.
