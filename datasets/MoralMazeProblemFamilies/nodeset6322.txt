Michael Buerk:	Anne McElvoy?

<br>


Anne McElvoy:	<span class="highlighted" id="node3">You wouldn’t think
that you were imposing a kind of domination on your neighbours if you
were just behaving very badly, and making everybody’s lives a
misery around you?</span> 


<br>


Alexander Brown:	<span class="highlighted" id="node16">It depends on how one
unpacks all of those terms.</span>

<br>


Anne McElvoy:	Well unpack it, quickly.

<br>


Alexander Brown:	<span class="highlighted" id="node34">Whether it means
interfering in those families being able to conduct a flourishing
life; whether it’s intervening in their property, in their bodily
integrity; in their mental wellbeing by continuous harassment or
nuisance.</span>

<br>


Anne McElvoy:	<span class="highlighted" id="node49">But you would be
intervening</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node51">so you would accept your non domination theory would
fall if you were intervening for the good of those around them as
well respecting their rights to be non dominated.</span>
