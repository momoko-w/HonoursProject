Alexander Brown:	<span class="highlighted" id="node1">It is permissible for
a state to engage in domination of people, provided it’s to prevent
domination.
</span>
<br>


Anne McElvoy:	Right. <span class="highlighted" id="node9">But surely what
we’re talking about here is non-domination</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node208">It is about a kind of
moral responsibility that the State also has, both to the next
generation; to children who grew up in a situation which may set them
off on a completely wrong track in life, in which people themselves
are often rather miserable and trapped?</span>

<br>


Alexander Brown:	<span class="highlighted" id="node226">Well that’s a
judgment that one might have</span>;<span class="highlighted" id="node235"> one might have moral judgement about
the lives these people are living</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node66">I think if we’re in a Liberal
society, as opposed to a Republican society, we might care about the
principal of neutrality;</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node70">that it’s not the job of Government to
favour or privilege any one moral view.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node72">It should try to be as
neutral as possible between those, except in cases such that people’s
chosen morality prevents other people from living their lives.</span>

<br>


Anne McElvoy:<span class="highlighted" id="node131">	The State can never
really be neutral though,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node133">because if it doesn’t do something that
also has an impact on everyone.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node135">So this whole neutrality position is
a bit- just a way of getting out of the question.</span>

<br>


Alexander Brown:<span class="highlighted" id="node176">	If we want to live in
a Liberal society that is also tolerant, we must have a set of
principles that we all digest and understand, that ground and
explain, and justify why we behave as we do</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node178">I think if one is a
Liberal, the principal of neutrality is as good as any other.</span>
