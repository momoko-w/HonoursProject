Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node352">Kenan, what is the good
life? I suppose is the question</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node357">What is the template the Government
is seeking to replicate?</span>

<br>


Kenan Malik:	<span class="highlighted" id="node25">The question of what is a
good life is important here,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node27">but I think part of the problem is the
distinction people have drawn between the State and society.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node29">So it’s
as if the State imposes on people the notion of the good life, rather
than as citizens ourselves we work through what the good life is.</span>
<span class="highlighted" id="node31">There are two different views about State intervention.</span>

<br>


Michael Buerk:	Anne McElvoy?

<br>


Anne McElvoy:	But Kenan, you can only
do it– <span class="highlighted" id="node91">I think it’s a very sensible distinction that you draw
between the State and society, indeed very Cameronian, very ‘big
society’.</span><span class="highlighted" id="node93"> But it doesn’t actually answer the problem;</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node147">if you
haven’t had that template then you can’t</span>. 


<span class="highlighted" id="node380">It’s fine to say to people, “You
can decide what the good life is”, absolutely; autonomy, fine.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node153">But
you do have to have certain rudiments of knowledge about yourself,
about structures, and how you live with other people.</span><span class="highlighted" id="node155"> I think that’s
what’s trying to be addressed here.

Kenan Malik:	<span class="highlighted" id="node221">The poor don’t lack
that any more than the rich.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node399">We’re talking about dysfunctional
families</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node406">the rich have as many dysfunctional families as the poor</span>.
So this idea that-

<br>


Anne McElvoy:	Indeed, <span class="highlighted" id="node421">but they can
afford to sort it out themselves</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node432">and these people can’t</span>.

<br>


Kenan Malik:	<span class="highlighted" id="node291">So the issue is one of
poverty, and resources.
</span>
<br>


Melanie Philips:	<span class="highlighted" id="node447">No it’s not</span>,
<span class="highlighted" id="node310">because there are many poor people who don’t live like this</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node470">But
what you’re surely ignoring, and what so much of our discussion
this evening has ignored, is that there are deserts around our
country where there is just serial misery and hopelessness, and
despair, and dysfunctionality</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node483">and these are largely poor areas</span>.
<br>


Michael Buerk:	And on that rather
depressing note, we’re going to have to draw it to an end. That’s
it for this week, from our panel: Melanie Philips, Claire Fox, Anne
McElvoy and Kenan Malik. Until the same time next week, goodbye.
