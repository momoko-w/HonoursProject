Michael Buerk:	Christian Guy, thanks
very much indeed. Our last witness is Alexander Brown, who’s a
senior lecturer in Contemporary Social and Political Thought, at the
University of East Anglia, and who’s author of ‘Personal
Responsibility: Why It Matters’. 


	<span class="highlighted" id="node7">I suppose the big issue here is where
the boundary should lie between the family and the State; how much
the State should be allowed to, well interfere I suppose is value
laden, intervene. </span>

Alexander Brown:	Indeed.<span class="highlighted" id="node29"> I think there
should be a careful balancing act of freedom.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node121">Liberal societies have
often known that the family can be a nexus for forms of unequal
opportunity</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node132">but we don’t abolish the family</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node33">For the same reasons
we should be very circumspect in the way we intervene in families,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node151">if
you would like to consider the concept of  non domination, freedom as
non domination – the non interference on arbitrary grounds in
people’s important decisions – then we have to be careful that
when we do intervene it’s to increase total non domination. Which
would mean not interfering simply because people are mad, sad and
bad, but because they are imposing domination on their neighbours</span>.
