So can I just then say, <span class="highlighted" id="node1">I don’t know about you, but
I think we all know people who will tell you about some terribly wretched
childhood that they’ve had</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node7">Really horrible things might have happened to them</span>,
<span class="highlighted" id="node22">and they’ve overcome them</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node37">They’ve basically not been fated by that</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node48">the whole
of their future is not being blighted, even though it might have been a
horrible experience</span>. Would you agree that that’s true?
