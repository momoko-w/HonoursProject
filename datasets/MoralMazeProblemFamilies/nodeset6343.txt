Michael Buerk:	Melanie Philips?

<br>


Melanie Philips:	I’m still trying to
get my head round your non-domination principle.

<br>


Michael Buerk:	Oh let’s not go there
again, please. Can we move it on a bit?

<br>


Melanie Philips:	Well I am going to go
there. <span class="highlighted" id="node295">If you take the classic Louise Casey situation: a mother,
serially deprived, not been parented herself, can’t look after her
child, the child is truanting, the child’s getting into crime, the
mother has mental health problems, the mother is abused. What on
earth has non-domination go to do with it?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node300">Doesn’t a Liberal
society have an absolute moral duty to go and help those people?
Especially the child</span>.

<br>


Alexander Brown:<span class="highlighted" id="node81">	I think the State
does have a duty to protect those who are vulnerable to domination</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node83"> I
think children can be vulnerable to domination to their parents</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node85"> I
think in your long list of ills that are suffered by this family
there are some things I think would be justifiable grounds, and other
things that wouldn’t be.</span>

<br>


Melanie Philips:<span class="highlighted" id="node325">	Well I would agree</span>.
<span class="highlighted" id="node124">There are many different aspects to this,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node126">but we’re talking about
the general sort of, philosophical underpinning of this.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node128">Does the
State have a duty to intervene, or is it wrong to intervene?</span>

	Let’s take another example. <span class="highlighted" id="node184">You
talk about neutrality as a principle</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node344">and Anne tried to push you on
that</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node355"> I would suggest to you, and I would be interested in your view,
that the non judgmental position that the State has taken now for
several decades, that lifestyle choice is what it’s all about, we
only care about whether the child is poor we don’t care about
whether the family is married or not married, and so on. That has
actually pushed mass fatherlessness, which has given financial
incentives to mass fatherlessness, which has produced untold misery</span>.

	<span class="highlighted" id="node194">That’s your sort of neutrality,
isn’t it?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node368">But it’s not neutrality at all</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node375">it’s produced
terrible harm</span>.
