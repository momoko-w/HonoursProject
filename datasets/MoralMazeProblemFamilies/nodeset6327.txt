Buerk:	Okay. Alexander Brown, thanks very much indeed. 


Let’s start I suppose at the central
rift of this discussion, about the, if you like, the responsibilities
of people – however many they may be, whether they’re troubled,
or whether troublesome, or whether they’re both – for the
circumstances in which they find themselves.

<span class="highlighted" id="node323">Your attitude Kenan, and bouncing off
the witnesses, two of the witnesses in particular, took the same view
as you. Was that they didn’t really have much agency themselves</span>,
their particular problems were entirely resultant of the
circumstances in which they found themselves.
<br>


Kenan Malik:<span class="highlighted" id="node58">	I said nothing of the
sort</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node60">My view is that the way people respond, people’s agency, is
inevitably in the context of the lives in which they live</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node62">Therefore
to concentrate simply on the individual, and his or her response, as
opposed to the context of their lives, is immoral.</span> 


<span class="highlighted" id="node373">When I asked the first witness about,
what was she doing – teaching people to live with poverty, she said
“No”</span>,<span class="highlighted" id="node120"> she was helping them manage their resources.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node66">It seems to me
what she was really talking about is forcing people to adapt to their
conditions of poverty, rather than challenging those conditions or
creating conditions where moral behaviour could better flourish.</span>
<br>

Buerk:	Anne McElvoy?

Anne McElvoy:	<span class="highlighted" id="node192">What on earth does this
mean?</span><span class="highlighted" id="node194"> Unless you’ve got some great scheme which nobody else has
thought of to completely alleviate poverty, you still have the same
question. </span><span class="highlighted" id="node196">You may have more or less of it, the scale may shift, the
relativities may shift, but you do have poverty to deal with.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node198">And you
have to come up with a moral response to it.</span> 


<span class="highlighted" id="node200">It’s actually, to my mind, rather
immoral to come up with this kind of structurally derived argument
that says, “Your job is really – or our job, collectively – is
just to say to people ‘we will not put up with these situations and
encourage political action’”.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node202">When really, what you need to do is
get in there, intervene in families where there is this misery, and
do the best you can.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node204">That surely is the challenge?
