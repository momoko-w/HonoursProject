Michael Buerk:	Kenan Malik?

<br>


Kenan Malik:	<span class="highlighted" id="node3">Are problem families, in
your view, problem families because they cause problems? Or because
they face problems?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node5">In other words, is it because they’re
disruptive or because they’re disadvantaged?
</span>
<br>


Christian Guy:<span class="highlighted" id="node38">	I wouldn’t call them
problem families</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node40">And I think the initiative is ‘troubled
families’, not ‘troublesome families’.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node42">I think we have to look
at these families as families that need a lot of help,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node44">and they’ll
be the first, often, to admit they need a lot of help.
</span>
<br>


Kenan Malik:	<span class="highlighted" id="node93">But whether you call them
problem, or troubled, the question still remains.
</span>
<br>


Christian Guy:	<span class="highlighted" id="node108">I think there are
factors around these families that mean that they have been let down
by Government, by structures, by systems – say the welfare system.</span>
I’ve touched on it just now, but it’s so important that we
understand. <span class="highlighted" id="node112">We’ve had a welfare system now for decades that says,
“We will pay you more to be on benefits than to take work.”</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node114">We’ve
had a Government position that has not been neutral on family
structures.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node116">So we’ve said- actually there’s a ___ [penalty
0:24:39] in the benefitsystem which says,“You will be better off if
you split-“</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node118">So these factors matter.</span>
