Anne McElvoy:	<span class="highlighted" id="node1">See, I had a problem
with both of the big ‘isms’ in this argument.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node3">From the last
witness, Alexander Brown, we heard the limits of ultra
Libertarianism,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node450">because of his fetish about non- domination – so to
speak – there was very little in which he would ever intervene</span>.

<br>


Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node459">Now don’t go all
‘Fifty Shades of Grey’, on me</span>…

<br>


Anne McElvoy:	<span class="highlighted" id="node473">Oh you’ve been reading
it too!</span> 


<br>


Michael Buerk: 	(Laughter) <span class="highlighted" id="node480">Reviewing
it.
</span>
<br>


Anne McElvoy:	(Laughter) <span class="highlighted" id="node491">It’s no
excuse</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node17">On the other end of it, we had Ruth Levitas, who basically
wanted to play a blame game with the statistics and had a sort of
moral displacement.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node106">I felt more strongly against that even than
Melanie,</span><span class="highlighted" id="node108"> because I thought what we had was a whiff of class war, and
a lot of moral displacement</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node110">She wanted to have some people made
guilty for falling short</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node112">but she didn’t want any focus where it
really counts for an awful lot of people, which is what’s going on
around them.
</span>
<br>


Michael Buerk:	Claire, and Kenan if it
comes to that. <span class="highlighted" id="node518">I was interested in the point you made with a couple
of the witnesses, Claire, about your objection to what you described
as parental determinism</span>.<span class="highlighted" id="node536"> In other words that one generation’s
fortunes are rather dependant on how the generation before them
treated them</span>.

	<span class="highlighted" id="node178">Is that not really quite ___
[0:40:03] in al this?
</span>
<br>


Claire Fox:	<span class="highlighted" id="node558">I don’t think so, no</span>.

<br>


Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node233">You don’t?</span>

<br>


Claire Fox:	No. I don’t.

<br>


Michael Buerk:	<span class="highlighted" id="node237">You think people who
grow up in very difficult families don’t run a risk of being
difficult themselves?
</span>
<br>


Claire Fox:<span class="highlighted" id="node239">	I think there’s a risk.
</span><span class="highlighted" id="node241">There’s a risk that they can be brought up into wonderful families
and turn into monsters.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node243">My concern is a sort of broader point, that
we now see people as though they’re going to replicate and
reproduce.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node245">This idea that you know, if your mother didn’t love you
or you had a terrible background – sometimes the children, the
daughters of those families become the most wonderful, careful
mothers precisely as a reaction.</span>

	<span class="highlighted" id="node340">So I just think you’ve got to be
careful.</span><span class="highlighted" id="node342"> I think in a way the first witness made some very
interesting points</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node344">I was trying to cross-examine her, but she
actually seemed to be quite concerned about some of the things coming
out of the Government</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node346">I think one of the things that we’ve got to
be careful about it, are we seriously saying that we’ve got a set
of good practice parents, good practice child rearing,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node348">and if you
follow this guide then everything will be alright in the world</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node596">We’ll
send the experts in</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node607">they’ll show you how to do it</span>, and <span class="highlighted" id="node614">all will be
well</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node629">You’re kidding me</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node640">there’s no chance</span>.
