 <span class="highlighted" id="node1"> troubled families or troublesome families? Is that the crux of it?</span> 

Kenan
Malik:
















I think <span class="highlighted" id="node1"> a more interesting question is, what areas
of their life do you intervene on, in order to bring about change?</span> What I would
say is that we – and perhaps if I give you a case study of the sort of family
we’re talking about, would be helpful?

Claire Fox:
















So can I just then say, <span class="highlighted" id="node1"> I don’t know about you, but
I think we all know people who will tell you about some terribly wretched
childhood that they’ve had</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node7"> Really horrible things might have happened to them</span> ,
 <span class="highlighted" id="node22"> and they’ve overcome them</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node37"> They’ve basically not been fated by that</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node48"> the whole
of their future is not being blighted, even though it might have been a
horrible experience</span> . Would you agree that that’s true?

The point I’m pointing out to you, is there not an
over- despite you saying “ <span class="highlighted" id="node3"> Oh I do know what you mean</span> ”, you then went on to tell
me that actually <span class="highlighted" id="node13"> the factors will lead to this</span> .

Michael Buerk:	Kenan Malik?

<br> 


Kenan Malik:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node3"> Are problem families, in
your view, problem families because they cause problems? Or because
they face problems?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node5"> In other words, is it because they’re
disruptive or because they’re disadvantaged?
</span> 
<br> 


Christian Guy: <span class="highlighted" id="node38"> 	I wouldn’t call them
problem families</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node40"> And I think the initiative is ‘troubled
families’, not ‘troublesome families’.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node42"> I think we have to look
at these families as families that need a lot of help,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node44"> and they’ll
be the first, often, to admit they need a lot of help.
</span> 
<br> 


Kenan Malik:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node93"> But whether you call them
problem, or troubled, the question still remains.
</span> 
<br> 


Christian Guy:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node108"> I think there are
factors around these families that mean that they have been let down
by Government, by structures, by systems – say the welfare system.</span> 
I’ve touched on it just now, but it’s so important that we
understand. <span class="highlighted" id="node112"> We’ve had a welfare system now for decades that says,
“We will pay you more to be on benefits than to take work.”</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node114"> We’ve
had a Government position that has not been neutral on family
structures.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node116"> So we’ve said- actually there’s a ___ [penalty
0:24:39] in the benefitsystem which says,“You will be better off if
you split-“</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node118"> So these factors matter.</span> 
Kenan Malik:	Sure, but let’s look at
the moral issue here. <span class="highlighted" id="node7"> It seems to me that there are two fundamentally
different moral approaches to this problem.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node45"> One is a kind of
rule-based morality, which says, “We will impose standards on
people, because that’s how they get better.”</span> 

	 <span class="highlighted" id="node56"> The other is to say, “Morality is a
form of human flourishing, which requires transformation of social
conditions.”</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node15"> That means not simply looking at the individual, but
to change the conditions and provide those sorts of conditions.</span> 
Kenan Malik:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node222"> It seems to me that
you’re taking the first notion of what morality is</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node227"> I’m taking
the second</span> ; <span class="highlighted" id="node233"> that’s the distinction</span> .

<br> 


Christian Guy:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node249"> No</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node9"> I mean the CSJ is –
it has for years now looked at social reform across a number of
areas</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node11"> I don’t see why it can’t be both;</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node13"> you have to look at
personal choices and responsibility, and also the conditions you
create around families that lead to those decisions.
</span> 
<br> 


Kenan Malik:	I agree, but <span class="highlighted" id="node60"> there are
many forms of state intervention</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node280"> It can provide jobs, build
affordable housing, provide decent leisure facilities, not close down
libraries or swimming pools and so on</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node291"> Why is it, for you, that state
intervention only seems to be coercive state intervention in the
lives and families of the poor?</span> 

<br> 


Christian Guy:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node121"> It’s not coercive at
all</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node123"> it’s about creating conditions for them to make their own
decisions</span> .

<br> 


Kenan Malik:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node125"> Well I think they might
find it coercive.</span> 

<br> 


Christian Guy:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node312"> No</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node186"> they actually want
help, </span> <span class="highlighted" id="node178"> and they respond well to the framework in which you give them
that help.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node333"> So, for example, if you create a structure that says “Make
decisions about family structures in a way that you feel benefits
you”, but the state gives you a neutral level playing field, that’s
a great thing</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node344"> At the moment it’s saying, “Split up, don’t form
couples”</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node355"> and that’s dangerous</span> .
Michael Buerk:	Just very briefly,
before you go; <span class="highlighted" id="node3"> is the concept of shame, is stigma and guilt, and
responsibility I suppose – but, is shame particularly, is that
useful in this context?
</span> 
<br> 


Christian Guy:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node16"> I think there’s some
political rhetoric flying around that I would not choose to be using.</span> 
 <span class="highlighted" id="node18"> I think this is about compassion, social justice, giving these
families a chance and no longer writing them off and leaving them on
a social scrapheap.</span> 
Michael Buerk:	Christian Guy, thanks
very much indeed. Our last witness is Alexander Brown, who’s a
senior lecturer in Contemporary Social and Political Thought, at the
University of East Anglia, and who’s author of ‘Personal
Responsibility: Why It Matters’. 


	 <span class="highlighted" id="node7"> I suppose the big issue here is where
the boundary should lie between the family and the State; how much
the State should be allowed to, well interfere I suppose is value
laden, intervene. </span> 


<br> 


Alexander Brown:	Indeed. <span class="highlighted" id="node29"> I think there
should be a careful balancing act of freedom.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node121"> Liberal societies have
often known that the family can be a nexus for forms of unequal
opportunity</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node132"> but we don’t abolish the family</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node33"> For the same reasons
we should be very circumspect in the way we intervene in families,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node151"> if
you would like to consider the concept of  non domination, freedom as
non domination – the non interference on arbitrary grounds in
people’s important decisions – then we have to be careful that
when we do intervene it’s to increase total non domination. Which
would mean not interfering simply because people are mad, sad and
bad, but because they are imposing domination on their neighbours</span> .
Michael Buerk:	Anne McElvoy?

<br> 


Anne McElvoy:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node3"> You wouldn’t think
that you were imposing a kind of domination on your neighbours if you
were just behaving very badly, and making everybody’s lives a
misery around you?</span> 


<br> 


Alexander Brown:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node16"> It depends on how one
unpacks all of those terms.</span> 

<br> 


Anne McElvoy:	Well unpack it, quickly.

<br> 


Alexander Brown:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node34"> Whether it means
interfering in those families being able to conduct a flourishing
life; whether it’s intervening in their property, in their bodily
integrity; in their mental wellbeing by continuous harassment or
nuisance.</span> 

<br> 


Anne McElvoy:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node49"> But you would be
intervening</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node51"> so you would accept your non domination theory would
fall if you were intervening for the good of those around them as
well respecting their rights to be non dominated.</span> 
Alexander Brown:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node1"> It is permissible for
a state to engage in domination of people, provided it’s to prevent
domination.
</span> 
<br> 


Anne McElvoy:	Right. <span class="highlighted" id="node9"> But surely what
we’re talking about here is non-domination</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node208"> It is about a kind of
moral responsibility that the State also has, both to the next
generation; to children who grew up in a situation which may set them
off on a completely wrong track in life, in which people themselves
are often rather miserable and trapped?</span> 

<br> 


Alexander Brown:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node226"> Well that’s a
judgment that one might have</span> ; <span class="highlighted" id="node235"> one might have moral judgement about
the lives these people are living</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node66"> I think if we’re in a Liberal
society, as opposed to a Republican society, we might care about the
principal of neutrality;</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node70"> that it’s not the job of Government to
favour or privilege any one moral view.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node72"> It should try to be as
neutral as possible between those, except in cases such that people’s
chosen morality prevents other people from living their lives.</span> 

<br> 


Anne McElvoy: <span class="highlighted" id="node131"> 	The State can never
really be neutral though,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node133"> because if it doesn’t do something that
also has an impact on everyone.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node135"> So this whole neutrality position is
a bit- just a way of getting out of the question.</span> 

<br> 


Alexander Brown: <span class="highlighted" id="node176"> 	If we want to live in
a Liberal society that is also tolerant, we must have a set of
principles that we all digest and understand, that ground and
explain, and justify why we behave as we do</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node178"> I think if one is a
Liberal, the principal of neutrality is as good as any other.</span> 
Anne McElvoy:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node180"> Is the problem that you
have with the State fundamentally that you think, philosophically,
that it shouldn’t intervene in the private sphere, in family life,
go into people’s homes – which I suppose Louise Casey’s
proposals would entail. Or is it that it’s just not very good at
it, and therefore it’s just not its role?
</span> 
<br> 


Alexander Brown:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node35"> I think it’s the
former</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node37"> but I don’t want to suggest that there’s no role for the
State.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node39"> The State can provide information, guidance, and assistance on
a voluntary basis.</span> 

<br> 


Anne McElvoy: <span class="highlighted" id="node68"> 	Well it can if they can
get it to the people who need it</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node70"> but otherwise that’s no use.
</span> 
<br> 


Alexander Brown:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node93"> Well it depends on
what basis you think they need it, and why</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node95"> I do accept that there
are cases where families are harming themselves and harming others</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node97"> 
and then State intervention in that sense is needed.
</span> 
<br> 


Anne McElvoy:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node219"> We are all in this
together, aren’t we?

<br> 


Alexander Brown:	Well…

<br> 


Anne McElvoy:	Someone once said.</span> 

<br> 


Alexander Brown:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node250"> Someone did say</span> .
















Alexander Brown:
Michael Buerk:	You have an opportunity
to answer, but not too long. (Laughter).

<br> 


Alexander Brown:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node3"> Well, I wouldn’t
regard myself as a Marxist</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node5"> but while we’re bringing the issue of
Socialist based arguments in this forum, I would also question the
role of market principles in some of the provision of social services
here</span> . 


 <span class="highlighted" id="node112"> We’re offering things on a rewards
based process, which is if the local government succeeds in achieving
its results then it gets more money. If it doesn’t, it won’t.</span> 
T <span class="highlighted" id="node13"> here’s an upfront, and later.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node15"> I don’t think it’s appropriate
to use the market here.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node17"> I don’t think there is an analogy between
the way a company would use rewards to push forward good employees
and not other employees.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node19"> 


I think there’s a demand of equal
concern that the State has for everyone, such that if these
interventions are not working for the most needy cases</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node21"> That might be
an argument for continuing to intervene, not pausing.</span> Michael
Buerk:	Okay. Alexander Brown, thanks very much indeed. 


Let’s start I suppose at the central
rift of this discussion, about the, if you like, the responsibilities
of people – however many they may be, whether they’re troubled,
or whether troublesome, or whether they’re both – for the
circumstances in which they find themselves.

 <span class="highlighted" id="node323"> Your attitude Kenan, and bouncing off
the witnesses, two of the witnesses in particular, took the same view
as you. Was that they didn’t really have much agency themselves</span> ,
their particular problems were entirely resultant of the
circumstances in which they found themselves.
<br> 


Kenan Malik: <span class="highlighted" id="node58"> 	I said nothing of the
sort</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node60"> My view is that the way people respond, people’s agency, is
inevitably in the context of the lives in which they live</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node62"> Therefore
to concentrate simply on the individual, and his or her response, as
opposed to the context of their lives, is immoral.</span> 


 <span class="highlighted" id="node373"> When I asked the first witness about,
what was she doing – teaching people to live with poverty, she said
“No”</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node120"> she was helping them manage their resources.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node66"> It seems to me
what she was really talking about is forcing people to adapt to their
conditions of poverty, rather than challenging those conditions or
creating conditions where moral behaviour could better flourish.</span> 
<br> 

Michael
Buerk:	Anne McElvoy?
<br> 


Anne McElvoy:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node192"> What on earth does this
mean?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node194"> Unless you’ve got some great scheme which nobody else has
thought of to completely alleviate poverty, you still have the same
question. </span> <span class="highlighted" id="node196"> You may have more or less of it, the scale may shift, the
relativities may shift, but you do have poverty to deal with.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node198"> And you
have to come up with a moral response to it.</span> 


 <span class="highlighted" id="node200"> It’s actually, to my mind, rather
immoral to come up with this kind of structurally derived argument
that says, “Your job is really – or our job, collectively – is
just to say to people ‘we will not put up with these situations and
encourage political action’”.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node202"> When really, what you need to do is
get in there, intervene in families where there is this misery, and
do the best you can.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node204"> That surely is the challenge?
</span> <br> 

Claire Fox: <span class="highlighted" id="node1"> 	I think ironically, that –
I’m no more sympathetic to economic determinism, or the idea that
poverty creates this than anything else.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node3"> The thing that is most
frustrating for me is that, and in fact our last witness is worried
about- a number of witnesses worried about over dependence on the
State.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node5"> I have, on this programme – and believe that there’s a
morally sapping character to that</span> , I agree. 


 <span class="highlighted" id="node9"> What seems therefore ridiculous to me,
is that in order to solve the problem of over dependency on the State
in certain families. What they do is, is they parachute in as the
State, and usurps people’s moral autonomy</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node11"> Your agency is going to
be destroyed that way</span> . One of the things that doesn’t ever get
discussed-
<br> 


Anne McElvoy:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node64"> Well you don’t know</span> 
 <span class="highlighted" id="node66"> because you haven’t tried it yet, </span> <span class="highlighted" id="node68"> and you don’t know what the
outcomes are.
</span> 
<br> 


Claire Fox:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node233"> But I do know that if the
State actually says that you are incapable of acting out on your
lives, without us teaching you, treating you like children – in
loco parentis, for the parents in this instance. Then obviously, what
happens to free will then? What happens to your capacity to act on
the world?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node124"> You’re just basically told you’re not up to it.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node126"> You’ve
got no capacity.</span> 

<br> 


Michael Buerk:	Melanie?

<br> 


Melanie Philips:	 <span class="highlighted hlcurrent" id="node196"> I have some sympathy
with that point of view,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node289"> but what struck me about two of our witnesses, Professor Levitas and Alexander Brown at the end, was that they both basically seemed to think that poverty is the driver of events</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node298"> Now, Professor Levitas was upset that the Government seems to be targeting only the poor for intervention</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node7"> I have some sympathy with her actually,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node320"> but not from the direction she’s coming from</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node11"> because I think the problem of family breakdown started with middle class people, like Professor’s of Sociology quite frankly.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node333"> But the reason why we should care about the poor, is because the poor are really the victims of this</span> ; <span class="highlighted" id="node17"> the poor are in the most disadvantaged of all positions.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node19"> They are left absolutely high and dry,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node21"> and they cannot cope with the consequences of this progressive and incremental social family breakdown.
Anne McElvoy:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node1"> See, I had a problem
with both of the big ‘isms’ in this argument.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node3"> From the last
witness, Alexander Brown, we heard the limits of ultra
Libertarianism,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node450"> because of his fetish about non- domination – so to
speak – there was very little in which he would ever intervene</span> .

<br> 


Michael Buerk:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node459"> Now don’t go all
‘Fifty Shades of Grey’, on me</span> …

<br> 


Anne McElvoy:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node473"> Oh you’ve been reading
it too!</span> 


<br> 


Michael Buerk: 	(Laughter) <span class="highlighted" id="node480"> Reviewing
it.
</span> 
<br> 


Anne McElvoy:	(Laughter) <span class="highlighted" id="node491"> It’s no
excuse</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node17"> On the other end of it, we had Ruth Levitas, who basically
wanted to play a blame game with the statistics and had a sort of
moral displacement.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node106"> I felt more strongly against that even than
Melanie,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node108"> because I thought what we had was a whiff of class war, and
a lot of moral displacement</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node110"> She wanted to have some people made
guilty for falling short</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node112"> but she didn’t want any focus where it
really counts for an awful lot of people, which is what’s going on
around them.
</span> 
<br> 


Michael Buerk:	Claire, and Kenan if it
comes to that. <span class="highlighted" id="node518"> I was interested in the point you made with a couple
of the witnesses, Claire, about your objection to what you described
as parental determinism</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node536"> In other words that one generation’s
fortunes are rather dependant on how the generation before them
treated them</span> .

	 <span class="highlighted" id="node178"> Is that not really quite ___
[0:40:03] in al this?
</span> 
<br> 


Claire Fox:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node558"> I don’t think so, no</span> .

<br> 


Michael Buerk:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node233"> You don’t?</span> 

<br> 


Claire Fox:	No. I don’t.

<br> 


Michael Buerk:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node237"> You think people who
grow up in very difficult families don’t run a risk of being
difficult themselves?
</span> 
<br> 


Claire Fox: <span class="highlighted" id="node239"> 	I think there’s a risk.
</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node241"> There’s a risk that they can be brought up into wonderful families
and turn into monsters.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node243"> My concern is a sort of broader point, that
we now see people as though they’re going to replicate and
reproduce.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node245"> This idea that you know, if your mother didn’t love you
or you had a terrible background – sometimes the children, the
daughters of those families become the most wonderful, careful
mothers precisely as a reaction.</span> 

	 <span class="highlighted" id="node340"> So I just think you’ve got to be
careful.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node342"> I think in a way the first witness made some very
interesting points</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node344"> I was trying to cross-examine her, but she
actually seemed to be quite concerned about some of the things coming
out of the Government</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node346"> I think one of the things that we’ve got to
be careful about it, are we seriously saying that we’ve got a set
of good practice parents, good practice child rearing,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node348"> and if you
follow this guide then everything will be alright in the world</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node596"> We’ll
send the experts in</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node607"> they’ll show you how to do it</span> , and <span class="highlighted" id="node614"> all will be
well</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node629"> You’re kidding me</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node640"> there’s no chance</span> .
Michael Buerk:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node352"> Kenan, what is the good
life? I suppose is the question</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node357"> What is the template the Government
is seeking to replicate?</span> 

<br> 


Kenan Malik:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node25"> The question of what is a
good life is important here,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node27"> but I think part of the problem is the
distinction people have drawn between the State and society.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node29"> So it’s
as if the State imposes on people the notion of the good life, rather
than as citizens ourselves we work through what the good life is.</span> 
 <span class="highlighted" id="node31"> There are two different views about State intervention.</span> 

<br> 


Michael Buerk:	Anne McElvoy?

<br> 


Anne McElvoy:	But Kenan, you can only
do it– <span class="highlighted" id="node91"> I think it’s a very sensible distinction that you draw
between the State and society, indeed very Cameronian, very ‘big
society’.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node93"> But it doesn’t actually answer the problem;</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node147"> if you
haven’t had that template then you can’t</span> . 


 <span class="highlighted" id="node380"> It’s fine to say to people, “You
can decide what the good life is”, absolutely; autonomy, fine.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node153"> But
you do have to have certain rudiments of knowledge about yourself,
about structures, and how you live with other people.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node155"> I think that’s
what’s trying to be addressed here.
</span> <br> 

[Cross
talking 0:41:58-42:03]
<br> 


Kenan Malik:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node221"> The poor don’t lack
that any more than the rich.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node399"> We’re talking about dysfunctional
families</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node406"> the rich have as many dysfunctional families as the poor</span> .
So this idea that-

<br> 


Anne McElvoy:	Indeed, <span class="highlighted" id="node421"> but they can
afford to sort it out themselves</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node432"> and these people can’t</span> .

<br> 


Kenan Malik:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node291"> So the issue is one of
poverty, and resources.
</span> 
<br> 


Melanie Philips:	 <span class="highlighted" id="node447"> No it’s not</span> ,
 <span class="highlighted" id="node310"> because there are many poor people who don’t live like this</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node470"> But
what you’re surely ignoring, and what so much of our discussion
this evening has ignored, is that there are deserts around our
country where there is just serial misery and hopelessness, and
despair, and dysfunctionality</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node483"> and these are largely poor areas</span> .
<br> 


Michael Buerk:	And on that rather
depressing note, we’re going to have to draw it to an end. That’s
it for this week, from our panel: Melanie Philips, Claire Fox, Anne
McElvoy and Kenan Malik. Until the same time next week, goodbye.

Philips:
















Anne McElvoy:
















 <span class="highlighted" id="node1"> Do you recognise – just on this specific point –
that for the State to start telling people whether or not they should have
children, however tempting it might be in any individual case, is a very, very
dangerous slippery slope?</span> 


Michael Buerk:	Melanie Philips?

<br> 


Melanie Philips:	I’m still trying to
get my head round your non-domination principle.

<br> 


Michael Buerk:	Oh let’s not go there
again, please. Can we move it on a bit?

<br> 


Melanie Philips:	Well I am going to go
there. <span class="highlighted" id="node295"> If you take the classic Louise Casey situation: a mother,
serially deprived, not been parented herself, can’t look after her
child, the child is truanting, the child’s getting into crime, the
mother has mental health problems, the mother is abused. What on
earth has non-domination go to do with it?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node300"> Doesn’t a Liberal
society have an absolute moral duty to go and help those people?
Especially the child</span> .

<br> 


Alexander Brown: <span class="highlighted" id="node81"> 	I think the State
does have a duty to protect those who are vulnerable to domination</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node83"> I
think children can be vulnerable to domination to their parents</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node85"> I
think in your long list of ills that are suffered by this family
there are some things I think would be justifiable grounds, and other
things that wouldn’t be.</span> 

<br> 


Melanie Philips: <span class="highlighted" id="node325"> 	Well I would agree</span> .
 <span class="highlighted" id="node124"> There are many different aspects to this,</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node126"> but we’re talking about
the general sort of, philosophical underpinning of this.</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node128"> Does the
State have a duty to intervene, or is it wrong to intervene?</span> 

	Let’s take another example. <span class="highlighted" id="node184"> You
talk about neutrality as a principle</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node344"> and Anne tried to push you on
that</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node355"> I would suggest to you, and I would be interested in your view,
that the non judgmental position that the State has taken now for
several decades, that lifestyle choice is what it’s all about, we
only care about whether the child is poor we don’t care about
whether the family is married or not married, and so on. That has
actually pushed mass fatherlessness, which has given financial
incentives to mass fatherlessness, which has produced untold misery</span> .

	 <span class="highlighted" id="node194"> That’s your sort of neutrality,
isn’t it?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node368"> But it’s not neutrality at all</span> , <span class="highlighted" id="node375"> it’s produced
terrible harm</span> .
















 <span class="highlighted" id="node7"> Professor Levitas, I gather you quarrelled with the
statistics</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node13"> You don’t like the definition of troubled families, or anything
much about all of this</span> . <span class="highlighted" id="node28"> Are you saying there are no chaotic families that place
an unreasonable burden on the State</span> .

 <span class="highlighted" id="node1"> Helen
Dent, your charity has been working with troubled families for 150 years or so,
hasn’t it?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node7"> Is the Government right in its definition of the problem?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node16"> Also, is
it right in its strategy for tackling it?</span>
