I’m actually
asking you, and actually you’ve congratulated our previous witness Neil, so I
will too. <span class="highlighted" id="node1">Say you’re in a situation; why won’t you think, rather than taking
benefits, rather than giving a speech, what I’ll do is I’ll do anything. I’ll
take any bits and jobs I’ll do anything because I’m not going to be dependent,
either on my parents or on the State; I want to grow up, be independent. I
don’t want to be beholden to the State. I don’t want to sit there passively,
and I’ll take a low paid, part time job</span>.
