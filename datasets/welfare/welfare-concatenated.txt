<span class="highlighted" id="node57">Mr Sutherland, what do you make of Mr Cameron’s
point that paying young people to move out of their parents’ home doesn’t mean
they’re independent, they’re just dependant on other people’s parents?</span>

Kenan Malik:
















<span class="highlighted" id="node1">Are
you not overstating your case, and at the same time treating young people as
though they won’t cope with living in a garret, bit of poverty but I’ll get by</span>.


















Claire Fox:
















I’m actually
asking you, and actually you’ve congratulated our previous witness Neil, so I
will too. <span class="highlighted" id="node1">Say you’re in a situation; why won’t you think, rather than taking
benefits, rather than giving a speech, what I’ll do is I’ll do anything. I’ll
take any bits and jobs I’ll do anything because I’m not going to be dependent,
either on my parents or on the State; I want to grow up, be independent. I
don’t want to be beholden to the State. I don’t want to sit there passively,
and I’ll take a low paid, part time job</span>.


















Our first witness, <span class="highlighted" id="node1">James Bartholomew; pretty clear
cut, pretty clear arguments, whether you agreed with them or not</span>. One of which
was that <span class="highlighted" id="node7">everybody could get out of unemployment if the government didn’t get
in the way</span>.

Clifford
Longley, [<span class="highlighted" id="node147">the polls seem to suggest that Cameron’s concerns resonate with
perhaps the majority?</span> PQ] [<span class="highlighted" id="node7">Does that majority include you?</span> PQ]

<span class="highlighted" id="node105">Well one thing you may not be aware of, <span class="highlighted" id="node110">because you’re not in this
business</span>, is just how much benefits have been cut already by inflation</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node7">This
was started under Thatcher, continued under Blair, continued under Brown;</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node9">the
real value of unemployment benefit in relation to average earnings has fallen
dramatically.</span>

<span class="highlighted" id="node1">Should the welfare state, in your view, be about what people need, or
what they deserve?</span>


















Clifford
Longley:<br>
















<span class="highlighted" id="node194">So people quite often talk about ‘scroungers’ and so
on</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node209">and I don’t think that’s right</span>. The way I would describe a lot of the
people I’ve met who have been long term unemployed is kind of defeated, kind of
depressed.

<span class="highlighted" id="node1">Now you used the word ‘incentive’</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node7">and there are two different ways of
improving the incentives to work</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node16">One is to change the balance of or the generosity
of out of work beneifts, maybe spend more on in work benefits like tax credits
and so on</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node31">Maybe we could turn our tax credits, which aren’t really tax credits
in the UK, into something you only get paid if you’re working</span>; <span class="highlighted" id="node46">that would be a
good way of incentivising work</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node61">But we’ve thought too much, funnily, about the
financial incentives to work, and not enough about the conditionality in the
system</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node76">What do we ask people to do in return for their
benefits?</span>

<span class="highlighted" id="node91">The idea of ‘Work Fair’, or of conditionality, is incredibly popular</span>.
About 80% of people support the idea that <span class="highlighted" id="node123">if you’ve been on out of work
benefits for more than a year, you should be asked to do community work in
return for your benefits</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node142">And they are right about that</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node157">because we know that
these programs from other countries, they work</span>; <span class="highlighted" id="node172">they really reduce
unemployment</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node187">In one of the US states that went the furthest in this in
diverting people from being on welfare, they managed at one point to reduce the
number of people on benefits by 90%</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node202">This is a huge opportunity that we’ve
barely begun to explore in the UK system</span>.


















Neil O’Brien:
















Owen Jones, <span class="highlighted" id="node1">do you think Cameron has a point?</span> <span class="highlighted" id="node7">Or do
you think it’s all just demonising the poor?</span>


















<span class="highlighted" id="node1">And of course it depends</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node7">but the point about a
welfare state is it was set up as a safety net, during a time of near full
employment</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node22">That’s the difference</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node37">that’s a crucial difference</span>, <span class="highlighted" id="node45">and the idea
behind it was that it would be for periods of sporadic unemployment</span>.


















<span class="highlighted" id="node1">I’m near Merthyr Tydfil, in
Wales, which has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country</span>; Iain
Duncan Smith said “<span class="highlighted" id="node7">Why don’t they just get on the bus to Cardiff?</span>” <span class="highlighted" id="node26">But in
actual fact, it was revealed, that for every nine jobseekers in Cardiff there
was only one vacancy</span>. <span class="highlighted" id="node41">You can’t just tell people to pull up their bootstraps
when there aren’t the jobs available</span>. 

<span class="highlighted" id="node52">What on earth do you expect
people to do in a place like Merthyr Tydfil, Claire?</span> I’d love to hear your thoughts on what
they should do. <span class="highlighted" id="node61">Should
they resort to petty crime, for example, rather than take benefits?</span><span class="highlighted" id="node76"> What should
they do in order to look after their children?</span>
